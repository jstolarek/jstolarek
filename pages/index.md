About me
========

<img src="/images/my_photo.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" />

My name is Jan Stolarek and I am a Research Associate at [Laboratory for
Foundations of Computer Science](https://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/), University of
Edinburgh, UK.  I am on sabbatical leave from [Institute of Information
Technology](https://it.p.lodz.pl/), [Łódź University of
Technology](https://p.lodz.pl/), Poland.  My research focuses on functional
programming and compiler construction, but my scientific interests range to
other areas of computer science.
