My name is Jan Stolarek and I work as Haskell developer for [BinarApps Sp. z
o.o.](https://binarapps.com).  I used to be an academic working at [Laboratory
for Foundations of Computer Science](https://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/),
University of Edinburgh, UK and at [Institute of Information
Technology](https://it.p.lodz.pl/), [Łódź University of
Technology](https://p.lodz.pl/), Poland.  I am interested in functional
programming and compiler construction.  For more information please visit [list
of projects I worked on](projects.html), [list of my research
publications](publications.html), and [archive of my blog about functional
programming](blog.html).
