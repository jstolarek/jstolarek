Yet Another Lambda Blog
=======================

In 2012 I started a technical blog about functional programming titled Yet
Another Lambda Blog.  That blog became inactive in 2016.  Towards the end of
2021 I salvaged all the posts from a Wordpress instance and placed them here.
Unfortunately comments, many of which were very insightful, were not preserved
by the migration.

Towards the end of 2022, I decided to reactivate the blog.  New posts will
rarely be about functional programming.  Expect posts on whatever it is that
interests me at the moment: retro gaming, console modding, board games, books,
programming...
