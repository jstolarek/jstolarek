A glance at some Haskell books
==============================

Today is a good day! I finally got my hands on two Haskell books: _Programming
in Haskell_ by [Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/) and _Real World
Haskell_ from O'Reilly. We'll take a quick look at them, but first let me
mention Learn You A Haskell for Great Good (commonly known as LYAH). If you're
wondering what is the best way to start learning Haskell then LYAH is probably
it. It's [available online](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), but you can buy it as
a book as well. It is written in a very accessible way - I've read most of it
and so far there has been not a single thing that was unclear in any way. The
only downside of LYAH is the lack of any kind of exercises. This forces you to
be creative and come up with your own problems or perhaps try solving problems
available on the web. Two common choices are the [99 Haskell
Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems),
which have a steep difficulty curve IMO, and [Project
Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), which some people don't recommend claiming
that one should concentrate on the language itself, not on the difficult
algorithms. Anyway, let's look at the books.

_Programming in Haskell_ covers rather basic material. It seems that some stuff
that is in LYAH is not here. It's hard for me to judge how many new material the
book offers (comparing to LYAH), but I have an impression that it explains stuff
from a formal point of view, whereas LYAH is more pragmatic and doesn't go into
theory of the language. There are exercises and I think that's very
important. I've also noticed some very nice example, namely the Game of
Life. The book isn't very long. It has only 170 pages. Despite its large format,
there's not to much text since the margins are about one third of the page
width.

_Real World Haskell_ is a different kind of book. In Poland such a thick book
goes by the name of a brick. It's almost 700 pages long and seems to cover lots
of advanced material. I don't think it's a kind of book that's suitable for
newbies. It doesn't seem to teach things in a quick and concise way, rather
going into many details. This looks like the book that every person that wants
to be a serious Haskell programmer has to read - I don't think there is any
competition to it a the moment. There's a lot of practical stuff: interfacing
with C, connecting to databases, using JSON, recognizing barcodes, testing,
parsing, making a GUI, concurrent programming, profiling, software transactional
memory and more. I like the fact there are many case studies. You can check it
out yourself, since this book is also [available
online](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) for free.

Now I have to find free time to read both of them.
