Saturday Web Overview
=====================

During last week I've encountered some interesting links on the web.  Here's an
overview.

  - Although I've read 10 chapters of
    [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) and four chapters of
    [RWH](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/), I find learning Haskell
    difficult. Not that I don't understand it. The problem is that I have a
    really hard time to create a fully working application. I was somewhat
    relieved to find out that [I'm not the
    only](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/90818/hard-time-learning-haskell)
    one and that it's typical for Haskell newbies.

  - In the [12th issue](http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/f/f0/TMR-Issue12.pdf)
    of [The Monad Reader](http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/) [Neil
    Mitchell](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/) published an overview of
    [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/). I find this paper very helpful,
    since Neil gives also some useful tips about designing a Haskell
    project. I've been playing a bit with some Haskell code recently, hoping
    that perhaps it could be turned into something actually usable.

  - Speaking of which, Haskell wiki also provides a [great guide how to start a
    new Haskell
    project](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program).
    Also very useful, although it assumes usage of darcs, while I use
    git. That's not a big problem, though.

  - There's a book called [The Architecture of Open Source
    Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html). It looks like there's
    a lot of interesting reading. Volume 1 contains a [chapter about
    LLVM](http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html) and [about
    Eclipse](http://www.aosabook.org/en/eclipse.html). Volume 2 has not yet been
    released, but there is a [draft of chapter about the architecture of
    GHC](http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/aos.pdf).

  - Just a few months ago I didn't know lots of programming concepts: lambdas,
    folds, currying, partial function applications, the Y-combinator to name a
    few. There are some more to learn: monads, which I'll tackle soon, and
    continuations. I have a plan to read The Seasoned Schemer one day (that's a
    sequel to The Little Schemer) to learn about continuations but in the
    meantime I've found a [continuations tutorial on Scheme Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?call-with-current-continuation).

  - Constructing minimal PNG encoder in Haskell seems [extremely
    easy](http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/2012/04/minimal-encoder-for-uncompressed-pngs.html).

  - I dug out an [interesting thread on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3208258/memoization-in-haskell).
    This time it's about memoization in Haskell. I wasn't yet able to wrap my
    head around edwardk's solution but it looks impressive.
