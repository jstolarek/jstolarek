Moving to University of Edinburgh
=================================

I wanted to let you all know that after working for 8 years as a Lecturer at the
Institute of Information Technology (Lodz University of Technology, Poland), I
have received a sabbatical leave to focus solely on research. Yesterday I began
my work as a Research Associate at the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science, University of Edinburgh. This is a two-year post-doc position. I will
be part of the team working on the
[Skye](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/group/skye.html) project under
supervision of [James Cheney](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/). This
means that from now on I will mostly focus on developing the [Links programming
language](http://links-lang.org/).
