August web overview
===================

Here's another quick overview of interesting links I found on the web:

  * I consider design patterns to be one of the most important skill when
    programming in object-oriented languages. When I started with Haskell I
    started asking myself what are the design patterns in functional
    programming? It seems that I've found an answer: [a blog written by Jeremy
    Gibbons](http://patternsinfp.wordpress.com/). While it seems to be inactive
    for many months now, the good news is that professor Gibbons is preparing a
    book on Patterns in Functional Programming.

  * Speaking of patterns, here's a short presentation on [Haskell Performance
    Patterns](http://johantibell.com/files/haskell-performance-patterns.html#%281%29).

  * A while ago I posted a link to [thread on Stack Overflow about stages of
    learning Haskell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell).
    If that's not enough to measure your progress then ["The Evolution of a
    Haskell Programmer"](http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html)
    might be more helpful.

  * An event called "Haskell eXchange" will be held in London on October
    10th. There will be talks given by Simon Peyton Jones and Simon
    Marlow. Here's [more info](http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/haskell-exchange-2012/te-4913)
    if you're interested.

  * In November 2011 id Software released source code of Doom 3. While I'm
    always interested in such stuff, I find it a bit to difficult to dig into
    the code on my own. Luckily, there's [a good overview of the source
    code](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/) available. Now it's much easier to
    benefit from knowledge and experience of id Software.
