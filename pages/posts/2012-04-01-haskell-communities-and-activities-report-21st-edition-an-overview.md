Haskell Communities and Activities Report, 21st edition. An overview
====================================================================

_Haskell Communities and Activities Report_ is a status report on Haskell
community as a whole. It's released twice a year and contains a whole bunch of
interesting stuff. I've just read the most recent (November 2011) report. Here's
an overview of things I've found the most interesting:

  - There's a [Haskell plugin for Eclipse](http://eclipsefp.github.com/). So far
    I've been using Emacs with [Haskell
    mode](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_mode_for_Emacs) but I'd be
    happy to see a decent plugin for Eclipse. I'll be testing it to see how it
    works.

  - At the same time I'm planning to enhance my Haskell experience in Emacs by
    using [ghc-mod](http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/en/)

  - [The Monad Reader](http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/) is a web magazine
    about Haskell.

  - There is a [Debian Haskell Group](http://wiki.debian.org/Haskell). I've been
    considering switching to Debian for some time now and it's good to know
    there is a good Haskell support for Debian (although I'd probably [still
    stick to the precompiled
    binaries](/blog/2012-03-20-installing-ghc-on-opensuse-linux.html) available
    from GHC site).

  - [HEAT](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/heat/) is The Haskell Educational
    Advancement Tool. I'll have to look into it and see if it has a good
    educational potential (for teaching others, not myself).

  - There is a [Haskell Natural Language Processing
    community](http://projects.haskell.org/nlp/).

  - Ericsson together with two universities (one in Sweden, one in Hungary)
    develops Feldspar: Functional Embedded Language for Digital Signal
    Processing and Parallelism. [Find out more](http://feldspar.inf.elte.hu/).

  - If you want to do bioinformatics stuff in Haskell then
    [Biohaskell](http://biohaskell.org/) might be of interest to you.

There's a lot more of in the report: games, web applications, compilers,
practical applications of Haskell, research and user groups. You can read the
whole report [here](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Communities_and_Activities_Report#The_twenty-first_edition_.28November_2011.29).
