Yet another web overview
========================

I haven't done a single web overview in 2013. It's time to fix that since in the
last few weeks I came across a couple of interesting online resources that I'd
like to share:

  - [Fun with type functions](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/MDCC-TechTalk-Fun-with-type-functions?format=flash) (2011) -
    Simon PJ's presentation of the tutorial paper with the same
    title. Covers associated data types and type families (see "Associated Types
    With Class" for an in-depth presentation) + some stuff found in Data
    Parallel Haskell (read "Data Parallel Haskell: a status report" for more
    details). The whole presentation feels like a teaser as it ends quite
    quickly and skips some really interesting examples found in the paper.

  - [Types a la Milner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=carP8i6YSZs) (2012) by
    Benjamin C. Pierce (he's the author of the book about types ["Types and
    Programming Languages"](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)). The talk
    covers a bit of programming languages history, type systems in general
    ("well-typed programs don't go wrong"), type inference in the presence of
    polymorphism and using types to manage security of personal information. I
    found the type inference and historical parts very interesting.

  - [The trouble with types](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-types-issues) (2013)
    by Martin Odersky (creator of Scala). Talk covers the role of types
    in programming, presents the spectrum of static type systems and then
    focuses on innovations in the type system of Scala.

  - I also found [an interesting blog hosted on
    GitHub](https://github.com/leonidas/codeblog). Despite only 10 posts the
    blog has lot's of stuff on practical type level programming in
    Haskell. Highly recommended.
