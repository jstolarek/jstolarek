Sunday web overview
===================

Here's an overview of some interesting web resources I've found recently:

  * First of all, I've found a [great question on
    StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/how-to-learn-haskell)
    that outlines stages of mastering Haskell. According to it I'm somewhere in
    the beginner level.

  * I've encountered many interesting pages in the Haskell Wiki.

    - First of all, there is a great [FAQ](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FAQ).
      I wish I found it earlier, it would save me a lot of time and effort and
      other's effort as well, since I was asking some of these questions on
      #haskell channel.

    - There is a very short and nice introduction to [I/O in
      Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_IO).  I'm
      already beyond that point in my Haskell education, but earlier it would
      have been useful.

    - A more in-depth tutorial called [IO Inside](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside).
      I've read some parts of it to clarify information from [Real World
      Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read).

    - A list of [research papers about Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Research_papers).

    - Tutorial on how to [maintain laziness in Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Maintaining_laziness).

    - A discussion of [Monomorphism Restriction](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monomorphism_Restriction).
      I tried to read Haskell 2010 report to understand why the restriction
      exists, but I didn't understand a thing.

  * There is a [Debug.Trace module](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Debug-Trace.html)
    in Haskell that allows to trace function calls as they happen. I guess it's
    not the same as log4j from Java, but I think it will come in handy.

  * [An old post by Daniel Spiewak gives a very brief overview of Hindley-Milner
    type system](http://www.codecommit.com/posts/scala/what-is-hindley-milner-and-why-is-it-cool).
    It is presented in Scala, but AFAIK Haskell uses the same. I found the
    comments below the post to be very insightful. Actually the whole [blog by
    Daniel](http://www.codecommit.com/posts/) is very interesting, but it looks
    like a difficult read.

  * There is a classical book by Simon Peyton Jones called "The Implementation
    of Functional Programming Languages". It's from 1987 so it's rather old
    (hence _classical_). In fact the Haskell standard wasn't even defined back
    then (not mentioning any Haskell compiler). The book is [available online
    for free](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm).

  * And last but not least, the [Tokyo Sch√∂nfinkel Appreciation Club](http://www.cynic.net/tsac.html).
