System Shock remake
===================

System Shock is a franchise that has been very influential artistically and at
the same time not a great commercial success.  Since the latter is the more
important factor in deciding which games get made it is no surprise that up
until recently we've only seen two entries in the series: the original System
Shock from 1994 and its sequel System Shock 2 from 1999.  That has recently
changed with the release of the long awaited System Shock remake, which I
finished playing a few evenings ago.

Before I talk about the remake let's quickly revisit two previous games and why
they were important.  System Shock games belong to the immersive sim genre,
which is typically characterized by non-linear gameplay combined with emphasis
on exploration, permitting players to solve problems in different ways
(e.g. direct confrontation vs. stealth), and RPG elements[^1].  In addition to
that, System Shock is a cyberpunk survival horror where you face a rogue AI
known as SHODAN, possibly one of the most known villains in video gaming.  Other
immersive sims you might have heard about are the first Deus Ex, BioShock (a
spiritual successor to System Shock that has been both critically and
financially successful), and Dishonored.

To me personally System Shock is an important series, though I somewhat feel I
am not entitled to saying this.  That's because I didn't really play the first
System Shock.  As for System Shock 2 I never finished it despite several
attempts at doing so, including a co-op one over the network some 20 years ago.
SS2 was just too difficult for me, the main problem being enemies that kept
respawning if one did not move forward quickly enough.  I remember having my
ammo supplies depleted and attempting to fight my way through with melee
weapons, which at some point was just not possible since enemies were too tough.
But despite these failures at completing the game I spent many hours with it,
and its cyber-horror atmosphere was very influential on me.  It got me to name
my computers after rogue AIs from science-fiction works, a habit that I've been
faithful to for the past two decades and including well-known characters like
SHODAN or GLaDOS, as well as more obscure ones such as
[WAU](https://soma.fandom.com/wiki/WAU).


Short history of long development
---------------------------------

Let's quickly talk about how the System Shock remake came to be.  It was first
announced to the public in 2016, when a [Kickstarter
campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/) was
launched by Nightdive Studios to fund the development.  Importantly, the
campaign was accompanied by a playable demo of the game that demonstrated that
the team has both a vision of what the game should be as well as skills needed
to bring that vision to life.  All it needed was time and money.  System Shock
is a beloved franchise for many and the campaign ended in a success, totalling
1.35M dollars out of 0.9M dollars requested, exceeding the requested funds by a
50% margin.  Funding was secured, vertical slice already implemented and the
release date set for late 2017 &#8210; what could possibly go wrong?

Apparently, a lot.  I feel the development history of System Shock remake will
be written about in books[^2].  A brief summary is that the team attempted to
expand the scope of the project and ran out of money.  Development was put on
hold, with Nightdive Studios searching for partners that would help fund the
game.  System Shock missed seven release dates.  Some of them in a very bad
style with announced date passing without a single word from the developer about
yet another delay.  These delays as well as other things that happened during
development have been detailed by user Shoot Man on GOG.com forums
[here](https://www.gog.com/forum/system_shock_series/what_a_surprise_the_release_date_was_a_lie/page3).
Despite the predictions of some that claimed the game will never see a release,
System Shock remake was finally released in May 2023[^3].  I am happy to say
that despite troubled development it is a very good game.


A great immersive sim
---------------------

In System Shock you play as the Hacker.  After a short opening sequence &#8210;
which, by the way, I found confusing, having trouble figuring out what I need to
do in the first room &#8210; you wake up on the Medical deck of Citadel, a space
station orbiting Saturn.  You need to make your way through the station decks
all the way to the bridge to stop the rogue AI SHODAN.  What is beautiful about
System Shock is lack of any explicit mission objectives and mission markers that
would guide you by hand.  It is up to you to explore the environment and piece
together transmissions from few survivors on the station as well as audio logs
of those who did not survive.  In the end you are left with knowledge of *what*
to do and it is up to you to find the required items and places where to make
use of them.

<figcaption>Audio logs are your primary source of information.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

The beginning of the game is difficult.  You are short on ammo so getting
through the initial decks requires relying heavily on basic melee weapons, pipe
and wrench.

<figcaption>Wrench is just slightly more powerful.</figcaption>

</div>

Later these get replaced by a powerful Laser Rapier, which is one of the best
weapons in the game.  Its only downside is the fact that it's a melee weapon,
forcing you to get in close quarters with the enemy.  This weapon is identical
in spirit to Dragon's Tooth sword from the first Deus Ex game.

<figcaption>Laser Rapier is still very useful even on the final deck.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Early in the game there's also a shortage of healing items.  You will find
yourself backtracking very often to a surgery machine found in Medical to get
your health fully restored.

<figcaption>Surgery machines fully restore your health.  Not every deck has one.</figcaption>

At this point it should be clear that System Shock is not a first-person
shooter.  Yes, it has a first-person perspective.  Yes, there is shooting.  But
this is not a game where you keep moving forward, ploughing through dozens of
enemies while shooting left and right.  Ammo tends to be in short supply and
that always made me think twice before firing.  Do I really need to shoot, or is
there a more resource-efficient way of disposing of an enemy?

<figcaption>Aside from ammo you will need energy to power cybernetic upgrades and some weapons.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Unlike many immersive sims, System Shock doesn't really have significant RPG
elements.  You will find cybernetic upgrades throughout the game, ones that
allow you to move faster, jump higher, withstand radiation, etc.  But that's as
far as character progression goes.  The only choices that you get to make that
influence your playing experience are weapons.  There are several types of hand
arms, rifles, and heavier weapons, as well as mines and grenades.  Additionally,
most weapons have two ammo types or firing modes, as well as upgrades.  This
allows for a variety of play styles and tactics that can be employed against
enemies.  However, inventory space is limited and each weapon takes up space in
that inventory.  There is no way to carry every single weapon that you come
across, especially given that ammo also takes up space.  Hard choices have to be
made and some weapons will get left behind.  My standard armament was the DG-04
Laser Rapier, Magnum 2100 Pistol (I ended up running out of ammo for it towards
the end of the game), KF-18 Scorpion SMG, and, last but not least, EM-83 Grenade
Launcher for dealing with heavy stuff.  The grenade launcher is especially
powerful when combined with EMP grenades, which can disable every enemy
(including bosses!) for several seconds.

Backtracking is an essential element of System Shock experience.  Levels will be
traversed back and forth, and revisited many times.  Since the game does not
guide you by hand, you also have a certain degree of freedom about the order in
which to explore the decks.  The first deck is Medical, followed by Research.
From Research you can go either to the Reactor &#8210; that was my choice,
though I think I might have made the game slightly more difficult for myself
&#8210; or Maintenance.  Maintenance deck is the closest you'll get to a central
hub in System Shock.  From it you can go further to Storage, Flight Deck, or
Executive.  Executive level provides access to remaining decks of Engineering,
Security and the Bridge, which are traversed in linear order, with Security
being the point of no return.  Certain enemies will respawn, so backtracking
isn't entirely stress-free.  However, game balance is much better than in System
Shock 2, so you don't run the risk of completely running out of ammo[^4].  Also,
most decks will have a respawn station that you can unlock to have your body
rebuild when you die, allowing for infinite attempts at beating through the
enemies, even if it's only with a wrench.  In fact at an early point in the
game, at the Reactor deck, I had to resort to this technique.  This was one
point of the game that I found quite tedious and regretted my choice of
difficulty settings.

System Shock allows you to adjust the difficulty of four aspects of the game:
combat, mission, puzzles and cyberspace.  (More on the latter two in a moment.)
Unfortunately, these settings can only be selected when starting a new game and
cannot be changed later.  As usual I went with medium settings and at several
points in the game I regretted not going with easier combat.  Having played
through the game though I have a feeling of satisfaction and think that combat
wasn't really that tough for most of the time, and a few difficulty spikes make
it all the more memorable.

Aside from combat you will encounter two other types of challenges.  First one
is cyberspace.  Throughout Citadel station there are cyberspace terminals that
transport you to a gravity-less 3D cyberspace, where you can move freely and
have to fight waves of enemies.  (Remember Descent?)  The goal is to destroy
large crystals hidden inside, which typically results in opening previously
locked doors in the real world.

Second type of challenges you'll encounter are hacking puzzles.  These come in
two types.  One requires rewiring a power board to deliver the desired power
output.  There are switches to redirect or cut off a path of energy, sum gates
that add powers of incoming signals and multiplexer gates that split one path
into two while retaining the power.  The other type of puzzle requires
connecting two buttons by rotating pipes located on the board.  It took me a
moment to figure out how these puzzles work, but once I grasped the basic rules
most were fairly simple.

As you might have already noticed, System Shock remake goes for a unique art
style, combining low-resolution environment textures with modern dynamic
lighting.  This works extremely well and results in a visually stunning
experience.  If there is anything I could complain about when it comes to the
graphics it would be the lack of diversity in dead crew models.  It feels like
every dead person looks exactly the same.  That's not a thing that hinders
playing experience in any way, but could have been done better.

</div>

Sadly, I can't give the audio side of the game as much praise.  Firstly, the
soundtrack is lacklustre.  The music isn't bad, but isn't exceptional either.
Having spent probably over 15 hours in the game the only piece of music that I
can now remember is a jingle played in the lift when moving between levels.  The
way the game switches between exploration and combat music is poorly executed.
Combat music kicks in 3-4 seconds after starting combat, but in many cases the
enemy is already dead by that time.  So the combat music starts playing after
combat has taken place and keeps playing for 10-15 more seconds even though
there is no threat nearby.  This is very confusing leading to a complete discord
between music and the in-game events.  Other problems with the sound are related
to noise made by enemies.  The way sound is implemented makes it very difficult
to determine enemy location from the noise they are making.  In particular, in
some places enemies can be heard through the walls in ways that should
absolutely be impossible in the real world.  All in all, both music and
environment sounds should support what is being displayed on the screen, but in
System Shock they really don't, which is a shame.

One last complaint I am going to make is about the ending, which is practically
non-existent and very disappointing.  I am going to spoil it in this paragraph,
though there isn't really much to spoil.  So you make your way through the
Bridge deck, killing SHODAN's minions, and reaching the final cyberspace.  That
one cyberspace is a special one: you don't float freely, but rather walk with a
weapon.  There is no usual health bar.  You can die, but if that happens you are
immediately respawned and allowed to continue.  In other words you can't fail.
This in itself isn't bad &#8210; symbolic fight with the final boss can be a
good way of telling a story. Once you destroy a large something in cyberspace (I
have no clue what that is) you are taken out of cyberspace to witness SHODAN
changing her colour from green to blue (presumably her moral restraints being
re-instantiated?).  Then the Hacker just sits next to SHODAN, tired and
exhausted.  And that's really it.  SHODAN, who has been a looming, threatening
presence throughout the game, stays completely silent.  Even as you make your
way through the bridge she barely says anything.  She no longer mocks or
threatens you, and makes no attempts to convince you to stop.  And then, once
the whole ordeal is finished, nothing happens.  This is very anticlimactic and
disappointing.  This ending left me with no sense of completion.  Admittedly,
the ending is faithful to the original one, but in that particular case I would
appreciate a departure.  Ending of the remake has been widely criticized and in
fact Nightdive Studios promised it will be reworked.  We are yet to see how this
turns out.

More System Shock, please!
--------------------------

Despite a couple of minor complaints System Shock remake is possibly the best
game I played this year and I am not saying this lightly, since back in April I
finished Final Fantasy X.  I really liked the atmosphere of Citadel station, the
omnipresence of SHODAN, and the retro-futuristic style of the game.  I hope
System Shock remake is successful financially and that we will see more games
from the series in near future.  So far things don't look particularly well in
that regard, though.  System Shock 3 has been announced to be in development
several years ago but it seems the development has been halted and the game is
now in a limbo, with neither cancellation nor development being officially
confirmed.  There have also been talks about the possibility of having System
Shock 2 remake, but this is again in the realm of wishful thinking.  Nightdive
Studios has the full rights to System Shock 2, so this certainly does not seem
impossible.  The only question is whether people would trust Nightdive on
another Kickstarter campaign.


[^1]: Note that there is no set in stone and commonly accepted definition of
      what an immersive sim really is, so take what I just said with a grain of
      salt.

[^2]: Jason Schreier, I hope you're reading this!

[^3]: Though the game has been released, Nightdive Studios did not yet deliver
      everything they have promised.  Aside from physical rewards (these are
      being produced) they have not released Linux and Mac ports, which were the
      first stretch goal.

[^4]: One game that had a very poor balance between supplying new ammo and
      respawning the enemies was Prey, an otherwise great game.  Halfway through
      my playthrough of Prey I was close to running out of ammo and had to
      resort to speedrunning techniques of literally running past by the
      enemies.  Searching on the internet reveals that I was not the only one
      with this problem.  Many people had to start a new game because they used
      up their resources (ammo, healing items) and no new ones were available.
