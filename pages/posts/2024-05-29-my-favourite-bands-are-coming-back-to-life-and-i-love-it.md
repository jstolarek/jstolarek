My favourite bands are coming back to life and I love it
========================================================

My late teens and early 20s have been a formative period for my musical taste.
It was back then when I started listening to hardcore/punk rock and its
derivatives such as metalcore and, most importantly of all, post-hardcore.  The
latter is a broad genre and many bands have received a post-hardcore label, but
my top favourites are Alexisonfire[^1] and From Autumn to Ashes.

From my perspective, years between 2003 and 2005 feel like a golden period of
music.  If I were to make a list of great albums released in those years, I
could easily pick at least fifty.  Sadly, as time went on, most of the bands I
liked either officially disbanded or silently went on an indefinite hiatus.
Reasons were many: starting a family and living a life, working on another
musical project, or sometimes an argument within a band that made former friends
part their ways.  This always made me sad, but I learned to move on and just
enjoy the old recordings.

But in recent years I am seeing a reverse trend: many bands that were at their
peak 20 years ago are now re-forming and recording new music.  I am not sure why
that is happening, though the collective loneliness and uncertainty of the
pandemic seems to have been a contributing factor in at least some of the cases.
In this post, I want to highlight three new records from the last two years that
have been extremely pleasant surprises for me.  Perhaps you will enjoy them too.

Intermission: Bandcamp is doing music distribution the right way
----------------------------------------------------------------

I like buying physical album releases, but since I don't have enough space to
store all the music that I listen to, I also like the idea of digital
distribution.  However, execution of that idea is often poor, either because of
DRM or because music is being provided as a service.  In both cases, one does
not receive ownership of what one pays for.  To me, that is unacceptable.

Enter [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

Bandcamp is an online music distribution platform, that truly sells music -
both in digital form and on physical media.  If you purchase an album or a track
you get to download it DRM-free in any of the most popular audio formats (MP3,
FLAC, OGG, WAV, AAC, ALAC, AIFF).  Importantly, Bandcamp also allows you to
listen to albums for free before making a purchase.  Hence, most links in this
post will lead you to Bandcamp.

In the past year, I've fallen in love with Bandcamp and now use it to make
almost all of my music purchases[^2].  Bandcamp isn't yet as big and popular as
Spotify, so not all bands can be found there.  Luckily for me, the ones I care
about are mostly there.

Anyway, let's get to the music.

*Otherness* by Alexisonfire
---------------------------

Alexisonfire is a post-hardcore band from Canada.  They are one of my favourite
bands and I can't help but truly appreciate their official website address,
[theonlybandever.com](https://theonlybandever.com/).  The band released four
full-length albums between 2001 and 2008.  They disbanded in 2010 and the
members went to play in various other bands (Gallows, City And Colour, Black
Lungs).  If I were to pick Alexisonfire's best album, I would have a hard time
deciding between [*Watch
Out!*](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/watch-out) and
[*Crisis*](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/crisis).

In June 2022 Alexisonfire released a new album called
[*Otherness*](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/otherness).  It wasn't
entirely unexpected since in 2019 the band released two new songs, [Familiar
Drugs](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/familiar-drugs) and
[Complicit](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/complicit), followed by one
more song, [Season Of The
Flood](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/season-of-the-flood), in early
2020.

One characteristic thing about Alexisonfire is that each of their albums
maintains the band's characteristic style, but at the same time has its own
uniqueness that sets it apart.  This is also true for *Otherness*, with the
album being noticeably calmer and slower than the earlier ones.  While I prefer
faster music, *Otherness* is a real joy to listen to.  I also appreciate the
band experimenting with new sounds, such as in the song [Dark Night Of The
Soul](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/track/dark-night-of-the-soul).  If I
were to recommend one song from *Otherness* it would be [Reverse The
Curse](https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/track/reverse-the-curse).

I also highly recommend [Alexisonfire's House of Strombo
concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WOyIMbk_as) on YouTube.  It is under
40 minutes and contains music from all periods of their career.

*Endless* by Leiah
------------------

Leiah is an emo band from Sweden, that released four records (EP + three albums)
between 1999 and 2003 and then went completely silent.  Note that when I say
"emo" I don't mean the kind of emo that became popular mainstream in the
mid-late 2000s.  Rather, Leiah follows in the footsteps of bands such [Sunny Day
Real Estate](https://sunnydayrealestate.bandcamp.com) or Mineral.  While Leiah
was never at the top of my favourite bands, they are certainly a band that I
like and enjoy listening to.  Especially in winter.

Leiah was always a band I found quite cryptic.  For long, long years there was
no information about them available online: no Wikipedia page, no social media,
nothing available on the streaming services, no online search results.  It was
as if the band never existed.  Things changed in January 2018, when the band
opened an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/leiah026/), released
[remastered versions](https://leiah.bandcamp.com/) of their first three albums,
and went on a tour in 2019.  I wasn't aware of this return to activities and
only learned about it when Leiah released their new album, called
[*Endless*](https://thirtysomethingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/endless), in
January 2023.  As such, it took me completely by surprise - a very pleasant
surprise, I must add.

*Endless* is 39 minutes long and features ten songs.  The music is similar in
style to Leiah's earlier releases, but at the same time it feels genuinely fresh
and new.  It is a comeback that is so good it almost feels unreal.  If I were to
recommend one song from the new album, it would be
[Surrender](https://thirtysomethingrecords.bandcamp.com/track/surrender).

<figcaption>The physical release comes with four bonus tracks (14 total).  Sadly, no lyrics booklet.</figcaption>

When it comes to Leiah's older songs, I highly recommend
[Week-End](https://leiah.bandcamp.com/track/week-end) from the album
[*Surrounded by
Seasons*](https://leiah.bandcamp.com/album/surrounded-by-seasons).

*The Revealing* by Stretch Arm Strong
-------------------------------------

Stretch Arm Strong is an American melodic hardcore band, that released five
full-length albums between 1998 and 2005. The last one, *Free at Last*, is a
real masterpiece.  Again, the band was almost completely silent for nearly two
decades.  And then in March this year - 2024, in case you're reading this in the
future - they released a new EP.

<div class="thumbnail">

With six songs, *The Revealing* is only 14 minutes long.  This might not seem
like much, but the songs are really great.  They are fast, aggressive, and full
of positive energy.  While many bands drift towards softer music as they age,
this is certainly not the case here.  *The Revealing* is pure energy, and I've
been listening to it several times a day for the past two weeks.  If I were to
recommend just one song from the EP it would be [Still Believe, Part
III](https://stretcharmstrongsc.bandcamp.com/track/still-believe-part-iii).

My only complaint about *The Revealing* is that, as of the moment of this
writing, the CD version of the album is not available in Europe, leaving the
option of purchasing either a digital version or a vinyl.

I also note that while Stretch Arm Strong has re-issued two of their old albums
on vinyls, these albums cannot be purchased digitally on Bandcamp.  Their
digital versions are only available as a bonus if you purchase the vinyl
release, which is a huge shame.

Still waiting for...
--------------------

All the three releases above are great albums that brought me a lot of joy.
While over the years I experimented with new bands and genres, I still come back
to my favourite bands from two decades ago.  Their music has a special place in
my heart and I am truly happy to see some of them come back to life.

I hope this is not the end of it.  At this point, my biggest hopes are for a new
album from [From Autumn To Ashes](https://fromautumntoashes.bandcamp.com).  In
the past few years, the band has been actively touring and releasing their
previous albums on vinyls.  A new album feels like a next logical step.  I keep
my finger crossed.

[^2]: To be entirely fair, Bandcamp can sometimes feel like a bit of a mess.
      The music is not organized by bands but rather by copyright owners. Sure,
      you will see all albums of a band available on a single profile.  But it
      is also common to have albums of an artist sold across multiple different
      profiles, often grouped with other artists signed to the same record
      label.  A good example is Shai Hulud, which has two different artist
      profiles: one for [albums released by Revelation
      Records](https://shaihulud.bandcamp.com/music) and one for albums
      [released by Metal Blade
      Records](https://shaihuludofficial.bandcamp.com/music).  The good news is
      that once you purchase an album, it simply becomes available in your
      collection and all that mess becomes irrelevant.
