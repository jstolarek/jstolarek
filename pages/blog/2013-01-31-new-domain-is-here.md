New domain is here
==================

On Tuesday I moved my blog to a different domain. Please update your bookmarks
to point to http://ics.p.lodz.pl/~stolarek/blog (the old address will redirect
you anyway) and your RSS feeds to http://ics.p.lodz.pl/~stolarek/blog/feed/.
Because of domain change your RSS readers might have downloaded all the posts
that you have already read - sorry for that. I know that in the past some of you
have been experiencing problems with my blog: the directory listing was
displayed instead of the main page. I am unable to resolve that problem on the
server I am currently using so the plan is to move to a more reliable machine.
New domain will make this change transparent. Big thanks go to my friend
[Robert](http://robert.nowotniak.com) for helping me with all of this.
