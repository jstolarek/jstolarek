Why dependent types matter (in Haskell)
=======================================

A year ago [I published Agda
code](2013-11-07-why-dependent-types-matter-in-agda/) for ["Why dependent types
matter"](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/publ/ydtm.pdf) paper by Thorsten
Altenkirch, Conor McBride and James McKinna. Now I rewrote that code in
Haskell. This work is similar to my recent [conversion of weight-biased leftist
heaps from Agda to
Haskell](2014-10-07-weight-biased-leftist-heaps-verified-in-haskell-using-dependent-types/)
so I won't go into technical details. As usual [you can view the code on
Github](https://github.com/jstolarek/why-dependent-types-matter).
