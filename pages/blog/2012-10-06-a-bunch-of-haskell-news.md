A bunch of Haskell news
=======================

A few quick informations:

  * [Manuel Chakravarty](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/) is [running a
    poll](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE1QZFNRLTFMdkllYWIyR2FkYnRzZHc6MQ)
    on community interest in a potential book covering advanced Haskell
    topics. Be quick to fill it out - it ends on Monday!

  * [GHC 7.6.1](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_6_1) was released
    exactly a month ago. See [release
    notes](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/release-7-6-1.html)
    for more details. Next version of GHC is scheduled for release in late
    2012/early 2013 (according to
    [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pucbf8_hGQ) video).

  * New release of [Haskell Communities and Activities
    Report](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Communities_and_Activities_Report)
    is scheduled for November. Contact [Janis
    Voigtl√§nder](http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~jv/) if you have something to
    contribute.

  * After a very long break, [new
    issue](http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/issue20.pdf) of
    [The Monad.Reader](http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/) was released in the
    end of August. It contains my "_Understanding Basic Haskell Error Messages_"
    tutorial aimed for beginners.
