        <h1 id="nd-edition-of-haskell-communities-and-activities-report-is-out">22nd edition of Haskell Communities and Activities Report is out</h1>
<p>22nd edition of Haskell Communities and Activities Report has just been released. Here’s an overview of new informations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell</a> was translated <a href="http://ssl.ohmsha.co.jp/cgi-bin/menu.cgi?ISBN=978-4-274-06885-0">into Japanese</a>. Japan is lucky, they already have <a href="http://www.oreilly.co.jp/books/9784873114231/">edition of Real World Haskell</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ezyang.com/">Edward Z. Yang</a> is now the editor of <a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">The Monad Reader</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a lot of progress on GHC development. Some features will be present in 7.6 release, some are work in progress with no release date yet. Among them are:</p></li>
<li><p>adding support for holes: you could write incomplete code with some fragments missing (these are holes) and GHC would report the type that hole can have. This is inspired by Agda.</p></li>
<li><p>There is work on new code generator, though I’m not sure how this relates to the <a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/05/glasgow-haskell-compiler-and-llvm.html">LLVM backend</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is possibility to change number of utilized cores at runtime. Previously it was possible only when starting the program and it couldn’t be changed once the application started.</p></li>
<li><p>SIMD instructions support for LLVM backend is on the way, hopefully will make it into 7.6.1. Since I’m doing mostly numerical computations I’m looking forward to it.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a lot of progress on Haskell web frameworks: <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/">Yesod</a> (stable version was released about a month ago) and <a href="http://snapframework.com/snaplets">Snap</a> (two major releases since the last report).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.fremissant.net/portackage/portackage.php">Portackage</a> is a new portal that gathers informations form <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html">Hackage</a>. It definitely needs more development work, but I think it has potential to become useful.</p></li>
<li><p>And last, but not least: Yet Another Haskell Blog is also mentioned in the report.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve found some other interesting things in the report, mostly informations about projects that concentrate on parallel computations in Haskell: Data Parallel Haskell, Glasgow Parallel Haskell and Parallel GHC Project. I’m especially interested in these - though I don’t have any knowledge in that area yet - because it looks that parallelization of computations can be done a whole lot easier within the functional programming paradigm. There are many new Haskell projects mentioned in the report as well, but they are beyond the scope of my interests so I didn’t mention them. Read the full report <a href="http://www.haskell.org/communities/05-2012/report.pdf">here</a> - you’ll most likely find other interesting stuff.</p>
