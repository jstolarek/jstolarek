<p>On Tuesday I moved my blog to a different domain. Please update your bookmarks to point to http://ics.p.lodz.pl/~stolarek/blog (the old address will redirect you anyway) and your RSS feeds to http://ics.p.lodz.pl/~stolarek/blog/feed/. Because of domain change your RSS readers might have downloaded all the posts that you have already read - sorry for that. I know that in the past some of you have been experiencing problems with my blog: the directory listing was displayed instead of the main page. I am unable to resolve that problem on the server I am currently using so the plan is to move to a more reliable machine. New domain will make this change transparent. Big thanks go to my friend <a href="http://robert.nowotniak.com">Robert</a> for helping me with all of this.</p>
