<p>I feel I can finally write about: I got accepted for a three-month internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge! This means I will be developing GHC and, hopefully, doing some serious research on the subject of functional programming and compiler implementation. My internship starts tomorrow, on 1st July. I’m not yet 100% certain about the exact topic of my research, so I’ll refrain from going into any kind of technical details for now and I will focus on my personal experience with functional programming. I feel this is really a good moment to summarize the past 1,5 year. I learned about functional programming at the very beginning of 2012 and since then I progressed from knowing completely nothing to being in Cambridge - something I would have not imagined 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Somewhere around July 2011 I finished writing my PhD. I had yet to deal with many formalities - which in the end took 8 months - but the most important part of my work was done and I only continued research on a few minor subjects that I ran into while writing a PhD. Somewhere in October I decided I need a break from all my current research topic - I finally wanted some time to pursue topics that interested me all along and for which I never had time. Compiler construction and theory of automata were two main topics I had in mind. That was the plan, but it wasn’t meant to work out, at least not yet. Somewhere around December 2012 I stumbled upon a book <a href="2012-04-04-7-languages-in-7-weeks-book-review/">“Seven languages in seven weeks”</a>, which was my first contact with functional programming. I didn’t follow the book exactly. I read chapters about Ruby, Io, Prolog (so much fun!), Scala and Erlang, but instead of reading chapter about Clojure I went for Scheme. I read <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a> language specification and <a href="2013-01-08-the-little-schemer-book-review/">The Little Schemer</a> and when I reached the chapter about Haskell I decided to read <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You A Haskell</a> instead. At that point I already knew that Haskell is <em>the</em> functional programming language and I think that this was the moment I started having some serious plans about functional programming. But at the same time I was figuring out how to learn about compilers. It was April when <a href="2012-04-20-stanford-opens-new-online-courses-about-compilers-and-automata/">Stanford University announced their two online courses on Compilers and Automata</a> and these were really godsend. The Compilers course ended in late June. This concludes my first six months of contact with FP and I think that these months were extremely intense. I learned theoretical and practical foundations of compilers, a new programming paradigm and some new languages designed in that paradigm. I also started reading research papers on functional programming, with a focus on implementation of GHC. At that point I didn’t even try to work on the source code, but I was trying to understand how the compiler is designed.</p>
<p>The next six months, from July to December, were not as fruitful. I picked up interest in doing data-parallel computations in Haskell, as this seemed to be an active topic of research and also related to my PhD work. I made a failed attempt of an efficient parallel implementation of a wavelet transform. Although I wasn’t successful, my time was not wasted: I learned how to write, test and benchmark libraries in Haskell and also read a lot of papers on FP. I also got in touch with <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~benl/">Ben Lippmeier</a>, who pointed me to one problem with GHC he needed fixed. This was somewhere in January 2013. I already started reading the source code of GHC in December, but now I finally had a particular problem to solve. It was the time to start working on GHC. That is mostly what I did during the last six months, although I also managed to spend some time on theory (more papers and <a href="2013-02-06-to-mock-a-mockingbird-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-learned-combinatory-logic/">a book on combinatory logic</a>).</p>
<p>As for the internship, I decided to apply for it in February. I polished my CV and cover letter (many thanks go to my friend <a href="http://www.mareklab.org/">Marek</a> for his help) and sent my application at the beginning of March. After an interview with Geoffrey Mainland and Simon Peyton Jones I got acceptance notification at the beginning of April. And here I am in Cambridge, over 1300km from home, waiting for my first day at Microsoft Research.</p>
