        <h1 id="dont-panic-its-only-an-upgrade">Don’t panic! It’s only an upgrade</h1>
<p>Time for another upgrade of my GHC installation. OK, I know I already posted about this twice but yet again the process was different from the previous ones.</p>
<p>My <a href="../blog/2012-03-20-installing-ghc-on-opensuse-linux.html">first attempts of installing GHC and the Haskell Platform</a> a year ago relied on using packages from my distribution’s repository. This quickly turned out to be problematic so I decided for a direct installation of the Haskell Platform. This worked perfectly fine except for the fact that Haskell packages were installed in different subdirectories of <code>/usr/local</code>, which lead to a bit of a mess and problems with controlling what is installed where (this is useful if you want to remove a package). So the second time I was installing Haskell Platform <a href="../blog/2012-06-06-upgrading-haskell-platform-on-opensuse.html">I was smarter and refined the whole process</a>. This time I confined the installation to a single directory so that both GHC and all the packages are located in a single, easy to find place.</p>
<p>Yesterday I figured out it would be great to get a new version of GHC. GHC 7.6.1 was released on 6th September 2012 and the updated 7.6.2 version is only two weeks old. While GHC 7.6.1 has been out for over 5 months it is still not part of the Haskell Platform <a href="http://trac.haskell.org/haskell-platform/wiki/ReleaseTimetable">and it won’t be for the next three months</a>. That’s too long a wait for me so I decided to send the Platform to <code>/dev/null</code> and just install GHC and its environment from scratch.</p>
<p>My plan to install GHC from precompiled binaries went up the spout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This build requires <code>libgmp.so.3</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watwatwat? Now what is that supposed to mean? Previously released binaries didn’t depend on one particular version of <code>libgmp</code> library. Of course my system has <code>libgmp.so.10</code> and any attempt to install an older version results in breaking package dependencies. I downloaded binaries anyway and tried to run them:</p>
<pre><code>[killy@xerxes : ~/ghc-7.6.2/ghc/stage2/build/tmp] ./ghc-stage2 --interactive
 ./ghc-stage2: error while loading shared libraries: libgmp.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>OK, so that requirement is true - you need the exact version of <code>libgmp</code>. So what now? I know! Compilation from sources! I’ve been hacking on GHC recently so I already have sources on my drive. Unfortunately it turned out that after switching GHC repo and all its subrepos to <code>ghc-7.6</code> branch I get some compilation errors. I wasn’t in the mood for debugging this so I switched everything back to master and <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/stable/dist/">downloaded the source snapshot</a>. From now on things are easy, assuming that you already have an older version of GHC on your system. After extracting the sources I copied <code>$(TOP)/mk/build.mk.sample</code> to <code>$(TOP)/mk/build.mk</code> (<code>$(TOP)</code> refers to directory containing GHC sources) and uncommented the line <code>BuildFlavour =</code> <code>perf-llvm</code>. This gives me fully optimized build using LLVM. Now the compilation:</p>
<pre><code>perl boot
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ghc-7.6.2
make</code></pre>
<p>This will build GHC and prepare it for installation in <code>/usr/local/ghc-7.6.2</code>. Fully optimized build takes much over an hour on all 4 cores. After the build is done all one needs to do is run <code>make install</code> as root. At this stage old GHC can be removed. You of course need to add <code>/usr/``local/``ghc-7.6.2/bin</code> to <code>PATH</code> environmental variable. As I already have mentioned I have the habit of installing all the packages system-wide in a single directory. For that I need to edit <code>/root/.cabal/config</code> file by adding the following entry:</p>
<pre><code>install-dirs global
    prefix:/usr/local/ghc-7.6.2</code></pre>
<p>All that is left now is installing <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install">cabal-install</a>. Grab the sources from hackage, extract them and run (as root) <code>sh bootstrap.sh --global</code> in the source directory. This installs cabal-install with its dependencies. Now you can start installing other packages that you need (a.k.a. compile the World).</p>
<p>This completes Yet Another Installation of GHC.</p>
