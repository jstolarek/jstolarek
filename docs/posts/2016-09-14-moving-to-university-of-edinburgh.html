<p>I wanted to let you all know that after working for 8 years as a Lecturer at the Institute of Information Technology (Lodz University of Technology, Poland), I have received a sabbatical leave to focus solely on research. Yesterday I began my work as a Research Associate at the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh. This is a two-year post-doc position. I will be part of the team working on the <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/group/skye.html">Skye</a> project under supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/">James Cheney</a>. This means that from now on I will mostly focus on developing the <a href="http://links-lang.org/">Links programming language</a>.</p>
