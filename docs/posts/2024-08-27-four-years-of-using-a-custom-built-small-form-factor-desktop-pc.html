        <h1 id="four-years-of-using-a-custom-built-small-form-factor-desktop-pc">Four years of using a custom-built small form factor desktop PC</h1>
<p>For the past four years, I have been using a desktop PC I have custom-built to
my own needs. One of its key features is that it combines high-end computing
power with a small form factor (SFF). My motivation to write this post came
from a recent online discussion I participated in, where someone not familiar
with SFF PCs tried to convince me (and others) that SFF PCs are bound to
overheat. As a long-time user of an SFF PC, I can safely say this is not true
and it such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a>
needs to be dismissed. I also want to share my experiences of building a small
form factor desktop PC, so that those of you interested in doing an SFF build
know where the challenges lie.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-personal-history">A bit of personal history</h2>
<p>The last time I built a desktop PC was back in 2006. It was an Athlon 64-based
platform. A distinguishing feature of my build was the case. I went for a
Chieftec Dragon mid-tower, made of thick aluminium and weighing 8kg. I thought
of it as a once-in-a-lifetime investment, just like a Parker pen. I was not
entirely wrong. The case still serves for my mum’s PC, though the internals
have long been replaced.</p>
<p>In 2011, I rented a small studio flat and started living on my own. I no longer
had the space for a large desktop PC and have switched to using a laptop.
Compared to a desktop, usability was quite bad, but I appreciated the mobility.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2019 I was thinking of getting a new computer. The
release of Cyberpunk 2077 was approaching fast, and I was planning to get a
proper gaming PC just in time for the premiere. (It would also be the first
time in my life to even have a gaming PC.) I was also quite tired of having to
work on laptops - the ergonomics were proving to be very bad for my health. As
a quick stop-gap solution, towards the end of 2019, I bought an external
keyboard and a 23" LCD and used both with my laptop. Having worked with
them for a couple of days, it was settled: I am going back to having a proper
desktop PC. No more struggling with laptop ergonomics.</p>
<p>That was late 2019. In early 2020, COVID happened. Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed
a couple of months, initially to September. However, seeing how the pandemic
wreaks havoc in the electronic supply chains, in March I decided to proceed with
the plan of building a desktop PC. As you’ll see in a moment, it was already a
bit too late.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-on-a-small-form-factor-build">Deciding on a small form factor build</h2>
<p>When the <em>“small form factor”</em> term comes around, some of you might think of one
of the mini computers, such as the Intel NUC or HP Elite. That wouldn’t be
entirely wrong - these count as SFF desktops - but what I mean by SFF are small
desktop cases produced for PC enthusiasts. I was sold on the idea of a small
form factor PC by a friend of mine, who built his desktop in a <a href="https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php">Dan
A4-SFX</a>. It is one of the best SFF cases
on the market with dimensions of 20cm x 12cm x 32cm and just 7.2L of volume.
With such a small size, my friend just treats his computer as a portable PC for
game jams.</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by the small dimensions. As you’ll see, these PCs can fit the
most powerful CPUs and GPUs. In fact, the best SFF cases are produced in small
numbers for enthusiasts who want to get the best possible performance, while
keeping their PC small.</p>
<p>From the beginning, <strong>I liked the idea of having a PC that’s actually small
enough to fit on my desk</strong>. I still had the memory of that huge Chieftec Dragon
case and how I struggled to fit it under the table. I’ve seen my friend’s PC in
action and envied how small it was. And so I decided to go with an SFF build.</p>
<p>I was planning on building a PC that is suitable for both gaming and work. For
gaming, I wanted an RTX card - these came to the market just a few months prior.
For work, I wanted a CPU with as many cores as possible. My major use case is
program compilation, and that’s when many cores definitely pay off.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-the-components">Selecting the components</h2>
<p>Having figured out my use cases and requirements, I was in for a lot of
research. One thing I quickly learned is that building a small form factor PC
is a bit like solving a puzzle. It is certainly an art of compromises, as one
cannot just put any components into the case.</p>
<p>The first choice to make was crucial: AMD or Intel? In the past, I had
experiences with both. While I still fondly remember my Xeon-based laptop, I
try not to take any sympathies with any of the companies and just pick the best
product. In 2020, it was certainly AMD, which made a spectacular comeback after
years of falling behind Intel. I decided to go for a Ryzen 9 3900X, a
12-core/24-thread CPU whose multiple cores would allow me to speed up my most
common use case - code compilation. Intel had practically nothing comparable to
offer, and getting an AMD was an obvious choice.</p>
<p>Once the platform was decided, it was time for the motherboard. The majority of
small form factor cases will only fit mini-ITX motherboards, which are 17cm by
17cm. These will have just one PCIe expansion slot and one pair of RAM
slots. Luckily, these are the only compromises one needs to make. Other than
that, mini-ITX boards can be as performant and feature-rich as their full-sized
ATX counterparts. I was planning to get a motherboard based on either B450 or
X470 chipset, but I was out of luck as all such motherboards have sold out by
April 2020, and it didn’t seem like they are coming back in stock anytime soon.
As an act of desperation, I had to get a <a href="https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-crosshair/rog-crosshair-viii-impact-model">ROG Crosshair VIII
Impact</a>.
It is a high-end motherboard based on the X570 chipset, designed with
overlocking in mind. Unfortunately, for this reason it is quite expensive,
about a double of what I had originally intended to pay for a motherboard. As a
bonus problem, Crosshair VIII Impact has a mini-DTX format instead of mini-ITX.
This means an additional 3 centimetres in length, making it 20x17cm instead of
17x17cm, and impossible to fit in most SFF cases.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, by that time I have already decided on the <a href="https://ncased.com/products/m1-classic">NCase
M1</a>. With dimensions of 33cm x 16cm x
24cm and a total volume o 12.7 litres, it is larger than many SFF cases. It
also can fit a mini-DTX board. I remember my wife having serious doubts about
the M1 due to its price - it had to be imported from Taiwan, adding even further
to the costs - but once she saw how well the M1 is made and how modular it is,
she agreed it was absolutely worth the money.</p>
<p>Next, the power supply unit (PSU). SFF PCs typically use PSUs in the SFX
format, a smaller variant of the typical ATX format. Choosing a power supply
was a no-brainer - Corsair offers the best SFX power supplies on the market.
One really nice feature they have is modularity: cables that are not needed can
be disconnected from the power supply, instead of dangling inside the case.
Unfortunately, pandemic once again proved to be a pain. I was planning to get a
750W PSU, but the only one I could source was a 600W one. Luckily, 600 Watt was
enough for my build.</p>
<p>Finally, the graphics card. When it comes to building an SFF computer, <strong>GPU
compatibility is something that needs to be taken into account</strong>. Graphics
cards have got quite large these days, often taking as much as three expansion
slots and having three fans on the radiator. Many of the largest cards will not
fit into an SFF computer<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I had to take those limitations into account and
ultimately decided on the EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 Super Black Gaming<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, a 2-fan
2-slot card that fits perfectly in the M1. Interestingly, I was able to get the
GPU just fine - major shortages didn’t happen until the second half of 2020.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I decided on 16GB of RAM memory (Corsair Vengence LPX) and
Seagate FireCuda 510 2TB NVMe drive.</p>
<h2 id="cooling">Cooling</h2>
<p>Figuring out the cooling is a whole separate subject. <strong>This is one thing that
needs to be done right with an SFF build.</strong></p>
<p>SFF cases tend to have quite strict limitations on CPU cooler height, though the
M1 is generous in that regard. After considering my options I decided on the
<a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-u9s">Noctua NH-U9S</a> radiator with two 92mm
<a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a9-pwm">NF-A9</a> fans working as the exhaust. I also
mounted a 120mm intake fan on the side bracket. The plan was to have the side
fan pull air into the case, and the CPU fans exhaust it at the back. This was
the starting point, but it needs a few words of comment.</p>
<p>Firstly, having two fans on the cooler proved to be inconvenient when removing
the cooler from the CPU. I didn’t think this would be a problem since I wasn’t
planning to take off the cooler once the PC was assembled. However, I ended up
assembing and disassembling the computer several times. In the end I decided to
remove the rear fan from the CPU cooler and attach it to a dedicated place at
the back of the case. Cooling works essentially the same, but disassembling the
CPU cooler is now a lot easier.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’ve run into unexpected problems with the GPU. The graphics card I
picked had a semi-passive cooling, meaning the fans only turn on once the
temperature reaches 55C. This looks like a great idea on paper, but its
execution is flawed. It turns out that during regular desktop work card’s
temperature oscilates around the 55C mark, resulting in fans constantly turning
on and off. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if it wasn’t for a loud, audiable
click every time the fans start or stop, i.e. every 10 seconds. Sadly, the card
BIOS isn’t smart enough to spot such situations and just keep the fans on. A
solution was to mount extra fans underneath the card. M1 allows to mount two
fans at the bottom of the case, which I did. Of course, any extra fans under
the GPU defeat the purpose of passive cooling on the card.</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about the fans. Last time I assembled a PC back in 2006 the
go-to brand when one wanted the best fans was Akasa. Indeed, they were great.
Quiet and extremely durable - the ones I got in 2006 still work without any
audiable buzz. Apparently, things have changed since then and in 2020 the brand
everyone recommends is Noctua. Because of that universal apprisal I decided to
go with Noctua fans. Unfortunatelly, despite good opinions, Noctua fans turned
out to be a major disappointment. I expect three qualities from a fan: it needs
to be effective, quiet, and durable. Noctua manages with the first and third
requirement, but not with the second one. I would expect that the only noise
comming from a fan is the hum of the air going through it. However, most of the
Noctua fans I bought emit a buzz and sometimes also vibrations (despite rubber
anti-vibration pads).</p>
<p>I initially started with five fans installed inside the case - two on the CPU,
two under the GPU, one on the side. Most of them would be faulty and buzz. I
went through several returns, RMAs, and experiments with different models
(Chromax, Redux). I had around a total of 10-12 Noctua fans go through my hands
before I finally found ones that weren’t buzzing. I also gave up on the idea of
two fans under the GPU. I couldn’t find the fifth fan that didn’t buzz and it
turned out that a single fan is enought to keep the GPU at 40C during standard
desktop work.</p>
<p>I admit that the four fans I settled on have been working fine for the past four
years without any problems, but the fact that majority of the fans I bought were
deffective is simply unacceptable. With such experience I can safely say that
<strong>Noctua fans are utter garbage and I don’t recommend them to anyone</strong>. I won’t
even mention the questionable colour choice Noctua has made with their fans -
luckily, there’s the Noctua Chromax line, which offers black fans.</p>
<p>Lastly, some people might want to consider liquid cooling. The NCase M1 is
designed for that, as are most SFF cases. The side bracket in the M1 allows to
mount a radiator with two 120mm fans, while at the back are two holes for those
wanting a custom liquid cooling loop connected to an external reservoir. The
reason why I didn’t go for water cooling was the uncertainty surrounding the
Linux support of water coolers. Back in 2020 there was no official Linux
software to control the water pumps. (Have things changed in 2024? Somehow, I
doubt it.) I didn’t want to end up with cooling that doesn’t work as intended
and decided to stick to the traditional air cooling.</p>

<h2 id="temperatures">Temperatures</h2>
<p>The first thing I did after finishing the build was running the benchmarks, to
stress-test both the CPU (using <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Prime95</a>) and the
GPU (using <a href="https://geeks3d.com/furmark/">Furmark</a>). With CPU, I was able to
heat it up to about 90C, while benchmarking GPU yielded a 76C temperature.
However, these results differ from temperatures obtained during daily usage.</p>
<p>The CPU’s idle temperature was originally around 44-45C, though over the years
it would slightly rise to around 48-49C. I presume this is due to thermal paste
deterioration. During daily usage, I found it extremely difficult to heat the
CPU past the 70C mark, even if compiling on all cores for a longer period of
time. Note that I have disabled Core Performance Boost in the BIOS. Core
Performance Boost is like a factory CPU overlock. Disabling it results in
lowering the CPU voltage from 1.4V to 1.0V and thus lowering the idle
temperatures noticeably. This comes at a marginal loss of computing power,
which is something I am willing to accept for a noticeable reduction in power
consumption, thermals, and fan noise.</p>
<p>The GPU’s idle temperature with one fan underneath it typically sits at around
40C, with a power draw of about 20 Watts. These numbers are for Linux.
Interestingly, on Windows the GPU idle temperatures are closer to the 55C mark,
resulting in fans repeatedly going on and off. When playing games, the highest
temperature I got was 80C in Metro: Exodus. This is higher than in the
benchmarks, suggesting that Furmark might not be able to fully saturate the
card.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h2>
<p>One thing I always had at the back of my head when building a PC are the upgrade
options. From experience, I know it is quite difficult to predict the future
upgradability of the assembled configuration. That being said, for this
particular build things have gone well since I already upgraded the RAM, the CPU
and the GPU.</p>
<p>In early 2022, I upgraded the original 16GB of RAM to 32GB. This was motivated
by requirements of <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and is something I intend to write
about on the blog. The tricky bit with this upgrade is that the DDR4 memory
these days comes in pairs of modules. However, small motherboards used in SFF
computers have only two RAM slots. As a result, it is not possible to simply
add more memory. Therefore, when upgrading RAM, I had to remove and replace
existing memory, which left me with a pair of unneeded memory modules that I had
to sell.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I decided to upgrade both the CPU and the GPU. I swapped the
3900X with a Ryzen 9 5950X, which is a 16-core/32-thread CPU. The 5950X has the
same TDP (thermal design power = amount of emitted heat) as the old 3900X, which
means no modification to the existing cooling was needed. After the upgrade, I
noticed a decrease in CPU temperatures, but I don’t know whether this is due to
better thermal performance of the new CPU or just because of new thermal paste.</p>

<p>As for the GPU, I went for <a href="https://www.inno3d.com/product/inno3d-geforce-rtx-4070-super-twin-x2">Inno3D GeForce RTX 4070 Super Twin
X2</a>. I
built my PC in the first half of 2020, and in September of that year, nVidia
released the RTX 30xx series. The 30xx cards were noticeably larger and would
no longer fit the M1. I was concerned that I won’t be able to upgrade the GPU
without replacing the case, but luckily with the RTX 40xx series, nVidia has
done a great job at minimizing the cards. The new RTX 4070 Super is smaller and
draws roughly the same amount of power, while being several times more powerful
than the 2070 Super - <strong>I am truly impressed with what nVidia have achieved
here</strong>. At the same time, the 4070 Supers are quite affordable, certainly a lot
cheaper than what I paid for the 2070 Super in 2020. The only real downside is
the new GPU power connector, the infamous 12VHPWR, which is a major pain. It
lacks flexibility and getting the side panel to close after installing the new
card was a challenge.</p>
<p>I have also run into an unexpected compatibility issue between the new card and
the motherboard. The 4070 Super has a backplate and the card would not fit into
the PCIe slot due to collision with the cooling block at the back of the
motherboard. The solution was to remove one of the screws holding the backplate
- this resulted in an extra 0.5mm of space, which was enough to fit the new card.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>After 4 years of using an SFF PC, I couldn’t be more happy with it. With a
16C/32T CPU and 32GB of RAM, it has all the computing power I need for work,
while a powerful GPU makes it also a high-end gaming PC. <strong>I never had any
problems with the temperatures, which are at a level comparable with a standard
PC. The single most important part of this success is the NCase M1.</strong> It is
small enough not to be a problem when standing on the desk. At the same time,
it has all the space needed to fit the components and provide them with proper
cooling. I am also very happy about the upgradability of the whole build.</p>
<p>This was my first SFF build, and it took a lot of research. I started thinking
about the new PC sometime in March 2020, and the build was ultimately finished
in July. Most of that time was spent waiting for a 750W power supply that never
arrived. Another 3 weeks went wasted because of the motherboard failure. The
one I originally got, died after a week. I had to disassemble the whole
computer, RMA the motherboard, wait for a replacement, and assemble everything
again.</p>
<p>Building a PC during the pandemic was also quite a challenge. I ended up
getting parts that I didn’t exactly want, but in the end I am not complaining.
The Crosshair VIII Impact motherboard proved to be a decent platform for future
upgrades, while the 600W power supply is, quite surprisingly, enough to power
both the new CPU and the new GPU.</p>
<p>The whole process of building my own SFF PC was greatly aided by the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OptimumTech">OptimumTech channel on YouTube</a>. This is
a treasure trove of knowledge and I highly recommend you check it out if you
decide to make your own SFF build. Note that here I have only focused on my own
experiences and haven’t talked about SFF builds in general. In particular, I
haven’t even mentioned sandwich layouts, i.e. mounting the GPU parallel to the
motherboard using a riser cable, instead of inserting the GPU into a PCIe slot.
So, if you want to learn about that, OptimumTech’s channel is the place to go.</p>
<p>This post has got a lot longer than I initially intended. I plan to follow it
up with two more posts. One will be about the AMD’s AM4 platform and its
stability issues, while the other about being an early RTX adopter.</p>
