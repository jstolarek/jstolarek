        <h1 id="saturday-web-overview">Saturday Web Overview</h1>
<p>During last week I’ve encountered some interesting links on the web. Here’s an overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although I’ve read 10 chapters of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">LYAH</a> and four chapters of <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">RWH</a>, I find learning Haskell difficult. Not that I don’t understand it. The problem is that I have a really hard time to create a fully working application. I was somewhat relieved to find out that <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/90818/hard-time-learning-haskell">I’m not the only</a> one and that it’s typical for Haskell newbies.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/f/f0/TMR-Issue12.pdf">12th issue</a> of <a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">The Monad Reader</a> <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/">Neil Mitchell</a> published an overview of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a>. I find this paper very helpful, since Neil gives also some useful tips about designing a Haskell project. I’ve been playing a bit with some Haskell code recently, hoping that perhaps it could be turned into something actually usable.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of which, Haskell wiki also provides a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program">great guide how to start a new Haskell project</a>. Also very useful, although it assumes usage of darcs, while I use git. That’s not a big problem, though.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a book called <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a>. It looks like there’s a lot of interesting reading. Volume 1 contains a <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html">chapter about LLVM</a> and <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/eclipse.html">about Eclipse</a>. Volume 2 has not yet been released, but there is a <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/aos.pdf">draft of chapter about the architecture of GHC</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Just a few months ago I didn’t know lots of programming concepts: lambdas, folds, currying, partial function applications, the Y-combinator to name a few. There are some more to learn: monads, which I’ll tackle soon, and continuations. I have a plan to read The Seasoned Schemer one day (that’s a sequel to The Little Schemer) to learn about continuations but in the meantime I’ve found a <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?call-with-current-continuation">continuations tutorial on Scheme Wiki</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructing minimal PNG encoder in Haskell seems <a href="http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/2012/04/minimal-encoder-for-uncompressed-pngs.html">extremely easy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I dug out an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3208258/memoization-in-haskell">interesting thread on Stack Overflow</a>. This time it’s about memoization in Haskell. I wasn’t yet able to wrap my head around edwardk’s solution but it looks impressive.</p></li>
</ul>
