<p>Recently I read a paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/">“A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With
Class”</a>
by Paul Hudak, John Hughes, Simon Peyton Jones and Philip Wadler. Now it’s time
to share some impressions.</p>
<p>First of all this is a very long read. It took me a couple of days to get
through 55 pages of dense, two-column text. Well, if you exclude the references
section length reduces to 45 pages, but that’s still quite a lot. The title can
be slightly misleading. This paper is about history but it is also practically
about everything related to Haskell. It describes creation of the Haskell
Committee, initial meetings and discussions about language goals, features and
name. But that’s only a small part of this paper. The rest is about principles,
features, contributions, tools and community. Of course all of this is placed in
a historical context and I must say it is very insightful to know the motivation
behind some particular language features. I consider hours spent on reading this
paper a very good investment. “A History of Haskell” is a great summary of
Haskell’s development process as a whole. As a beginner I learned a lot of
things about the language that I wasn’t aware of. Wide overview of literature
presented in the paper gives a general idea on what is researched in the Haskell
world, which gives me some ideas where to go with my own research. This paper is
definitely a must-read for people diving into Haskell!</p>
