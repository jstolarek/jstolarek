<p>About a year ago I bought two rather obscure handheld consoles: a NeoGeo Pocket
Color (NGPC) and a WonderSwan Color (WSC). Both were competitors to the GameBoy
Color (GBC) and both lost. Due to their smaller popularity they are not as well
known as the GameBoy and also command higher prices today, since there were
fever of them produces. Also, neither the NGPC nor the WSC had a backlit
screen, so in order to be used comfortably they need an IPS mod. Today I will
write about installing a modern IPS panel in the NGPC.</p>

<p>Before moving on there’s an important disclaimer. NeoGeo Pocket comes in three
versions. There’s the original NeoGeo Pocket with a monochrome screen. It was
on the market for about a year (1998-1999) and never officially left Japan.
Then there is the NeoGeo Pocket Color that I will be talking about in this post.
It was distributed worldwide, even if only for a couple of months, but mine is a
Japanese unit. Finally, there’s a smaller version of NGPC, officially known as
the New NeoGeo Pocket Color. These days people commonly refer to it as NGPC
Slim. Due to smaller size NGPC Slim is more difficult to mod.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-mod">About the mod</h2>
<p>When modding the GameBoys I usually rely on parts from FunnyPlaying. However,
they only offer mods for the GameBoys. Looking at the online retro communities
it seems that when it comes to the NeoGeo Pocket people tend to order from the
<a href="https://pl.aliexpress.com/store/5374188">Cloud Game Store</a> on AliExpress. And
so I bought from them an IPS panel mod as well as a new replacement shell. The
choice of shells isn’t great to be honest. I went with a transparent black
shell and also ended up installing original black buttons from my console,
instead of clear transparent ones that came with the kit. Moreover, both the
IPS panel and the shell are noticeably more expensive than in case of the
GameBoys.</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-screen">Installing the screen</h2>
<p>For the most part installation is straightforward. First step is disassembly:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<p>The first tricky bit is the metal cover separating the cartridge slot and the
main board. The one that comes with the kit doesn’t fit the shell very well so
I had to re-use the original one. However, reusing original screws was not a
good idea, as the screw holes are significantly smaller on the replacement
shell.</p>

<p>Installing the screen itself turned out to be tricky. There is no spacing
bracket so one has to rely on a small plastic spacer and a piece of foam
provided with the kit. This is far from perfect. There is also a dust seal to
be used to permanently attach the IPS panel to the shell. However, the IPS
panel is quite narrow and so it only attaches to the top and bottom of the seal,
making it possible for the dust to come in from the sides. Also, at first I
couldn’t figure out the orientation of the panel, since it’s nearly square is
shape.</p>

<p>The board needs to be powered directly from the battery, which is done with an
extra wire. Installation instructions say to just wrap the wire around the
battery contact, but I decided to solder it contact point on the board instead.</p>

<p>With the power wire in place the shell is ready for final assembly. At this
point the touch sensor needs to carefully aligned so that it touches the top of
the shell. It will allow adjusting the brightness as well as selecting one of
several available scanline modes. There are horizontal and vertical ones, as
well as a retro-pixel grid. Personally, I found scanlines to be way too dark so
I have them turned off. It is also possible to switch the screen to a
monochrome mode.</p>
<p>Here’s the finished build:</p>

<p>A few quick thoughts on this kit:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Shell quality is good, but the fit could be somewhat better. The top of
the shell isn’t as tight as it should be, no matter how tightly I fix the
screws.</li>
</ol>

<li><p>In order to get the speaker to fit I had to remove its metal protective
cover.</p></li>
<li><p>I messed up when attaching the lens and left a fingerprint underneath it.
What I learned is that once the lens is removed with a suction cup it can
be attached again, so I was able to get that fingerprint removed without
having to get a new lens.</p></li>
<li><p>I am yet to determine the battery life of the modded system. I had the
console power off without a warning a couple of times. The original system
supposedly runs for as long as 40 hours on a pair of AA batteries, but an
IPS panel and a flashcart certainly reduce that time. I hope this
unexpected powering off isn’t a sign of a deeper problem.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Over the course of time I was able to get a couple of original games for the
system (sadly, cartridges only - no boxes) but I also got a <a href="https://www.retrotowers.co.uk/flash-carts/neopocket-gamedrive">NeoPocket
GameDrive</a>
flashcart. Without a flashcart it’s really difficult to enjoy the system since
the game prices for NGPC are very high. Compared to the Everdrive cartridges
from Krikzz, the GameDrive is moderately convenient to use. It has 15MB of
flash memory and the games need to be loaded from an SD card into that memory
before they can be played. Once a game is loaded it stays in flash until you
delete it. 15 MB is enough to store several games, but the flashing process is
very slow, so if you want to play multiple titles you might find yourself
waiting quite a lot.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves I was afraid that NGPC will be nothing more than an
expensive curiosity, but it actually has quite a lot to offer. At least for a
NeoGeo MVS fan like myself. I spent a lot of time playing arcade titles such as
Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and The Last Blade. All of these
titles have their NGPC ports, though calling them “ports” is a bit of a stretch.
Today we would call them demakes. Regardless of how we call them however, they
are a blast to play. I was genuinely surprised that despite simple graphics -
the character sprites consist of only three colours - The Last Blade plays just
like in the arcade version. Same goes for King of Fighters and SNK vs. Capcom.
These games are so enjoyable not only because of how responsive they are and how
accurately they recreate the arcade feel of original titles, but also thanks to
the joystick that the NGPC uses. Instead of the usual D-pad the console has a
small, clicky joystick, and that joystick makes it possible to easily execute
all the tricky inputs required in fighting games. This is in stark contrast
with, say, GameBoy Advance, which offers arcade-perfect ports of King of Fighters
games, but the D-pad makes it nearly impossible to reliably execute any special
moves.</p>
<p>Also I’d love to be able to play some fighting games in the Versus mode between
two consoles. This doesn’t seem likely though, given that link cables to
connect two consoles are practically unavailable on the second-hand market. And
when they are they sell for well over a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>That being said, I will certainly be looking to get one more NeoGeo Pocket, this
time possibly a Slim variant. This console has certainly turned out to be much
more than I expected.</p>
