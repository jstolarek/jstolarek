        <h1 id="playing-final-fantasy-ix-for-the-first-time-in-2022">Playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time in 2022</h1>
<p>My gaming in 2022 wad dominated by two franchises: Final Fantasy and Metroid. I
re-played Super Metroid and Final Fantasy VI on original hardware, finished
Metroid Dread and Final Fantasy VII Remake, both latest entries in the series.
Finally, I managed to beat Samues: Metroid Returns, Metroid Prime 2 and Final
Fantasy IX. Today I want to talk about Final Fantasy IX, while it remains fresh
in my mind, leaving other mentioned games for possible retrospective posts
sometime in the future. I have had FFIX on my bucket list for a couple of years
now. I made one attempt at playing it around three years ago, but stalled about
four hours into the game. Four weeks ago I made a completely spontaneous
decision to play FFIX and this time the playthrough went smoothly right to the
end.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy IX is sometimes described as a “love letter to earlier entries in
the series” and a “return to the roots”. Indeed, after three earlier
instalments being placed in worlds that were more and more gravitating towards
sci-fi setting, this entry returns to fantasy roots seen in first five parts of
Final Fantasy. Of course when I say “fantasy” I mean “fantasy with airships”.
It wouldn’t be Final Fantasy otherwise!</p>

<p>Final Fantasy IX has interesting story and great character writing. It was
Final Fantasy VII that became famous for their characters (few gamers haven’t
heard about Cloud or Aerith), but FFIX is equally good. Characters have their
own unique personalities and motivations, with my personal favourite being Vivi.
One notable exception to quality of character writing is Amarant. He has no
backstory, no purpose, no motivation behind his actions, and almost no
personality. Many of the game’s NPCs are written in more detail than him.
Amarant only serves as a pretext to have some lines about importance of working
with others. Overall he feels like an afterthought and the game would probably
be better without him. I also have a minor nitpick about Eiko. While she’s a
great character, according to the game story she’s only six years old. Except
that her words and actions certainly don’t fit a child. In particular her
initial fixation on having a romantic relationship with Zidane is weird, to say
the least.</p>

<p>When it comes to character progression system, each character has an assigned
class. Those classes will be familiar to FF veterans (Black Mage, White Mage,
Thief, etc.), but in FFIX these classes come with a twist as each character now
has access to two types of class-specific commands. And so for example Zidane,
Freya, and Amarant have their typical class-based commands (Steal for thief
Zidane, Jump for dragon knight Freya and Throw for ninja Amarant) but each of
them also has access to unique spells only they can use in battle. Similarly
white mages Dagger and Eiko are now also Summoners, each of them having a
different set of summoning spells, while black mage Vivi can Focus to make his
spell in the next turn more powerful. Each character can also learn static
abilities that can be equipped from the menu between battles:</p>

</div>
<p>All abilities - both class-specific spells as well as static abilities - are
learned from equipment items (weapons, armours, accessories, etc.), similarly to
how magic was learned from Espers in Final Fantasy VI. And similarly to magic
system from FFVI I often found myself changing the equipment after every single
battle because one of the characters learned a new ability and I wanted to equip
them with something different so that they begin learning a new ability. There
were moments when this became a bit tedious but overall it wasn’t a big deal.
Overall the ability system is fairly simple and doesn’t really offer any freedom
when it comes to character builds.</p>
<p>When it comes to battles, Final Fantasy IX uses a classic turn based ATB (Active
Time Battle) system, where characters wait until their action gauge fills up
(how fast this happens depends on character’s speed) and once it does they can
execute their action. The “Active” part of ATB means that enemies are allowed
to attack while the player is selecting actions from the menu, putting some
extra pressure on the player to act fast. This however always remained optional
and when playing Final Fantasies I have always disabled the “active” part of
ATB, allowing me to pick actions on my turn without rush.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have anything good to say about implementation of ATB in
Final Fantasy IX. Earlier entries in the series got the ATB system right but
for some reason FFIX gets it wrong. In FFIX enemies seem to be largely
unaffected by ATB turn order. They perform actions at arbitrary moments, often
attacking several times in a row or in between series of attacks that one would
think should not be interruptible, e.g. character casting two spells as part of
Trance. (More on Trance below.) This completely destroys flow of battle and
derails decision making process in player’s head. In the time between the
decision to execute a particular action to the time of actually executing that
decision situation on the battlefield can change completely. This is further
exacerbated by various time-based effects, such as poison or regen, that work in
real-time rather than working in turn-time. This completely breaks balance of
poison an regen, among other things. For example, your character gets poisoned
and you use Antidote on them immediately. Oh, but some time earlier you also
decided to cast Bahamut, a powerful summon spell with lengthy animation, and it
gets cast now. Well, bad luck. Poisoned character will likely die because
their life drops every few seconds during summon animation. Conversely, Regen
status has become extremely overpowered. Especially with Auto-Regen ability
characters are able to recover most of their HP during spell animations, making
end-game significantly easier than it probably should be. And lastly,
pre-emptive strikes are also broken. During a pre-emptive strike your party
attacks enemy from behind - this happens randomly once in a while - and all of
your party members should be able to execute their attacks before enemies’ ATB
timer even starts ticking. Again, this is not the case in Final Fantasy IX.
During a pre-emptive strike it is not uncommon to have enemy attack right after
your first attack and before the rest of your team gets a chance to attack, thus
completely missing the point of a pre-emptive strike.</p>
<p>And then there’s questionable Trance mechanic to top it all. Trance is like
Limit Break in Final Fantasy VII or Overdrive in Final Fantasy X. As character
gets attacked a special gauge fills up and once the gauge is full character gets
access to a powerful special move. Trance is a bit different in that, rather
than being a single move, it lasts for several turns and for its duration allows
to execute special moves. For example Vivi can cast two spells on his turn
while Dagger’s summoning spells become more powerful. This is all fine. The
real problem with Trance is that it activates automatically when the Trance
gauge is full. The player has therefore absolutely no control over Trance
activation. As a result Trances get activated at completely random times, for
example during irrelevant world map battle, or right before a boss fight, or
right at the end of a fight giving character no chance to make any use of
Trance. As a result player has not strategic control over Trance and the whole
mechanic becomes a completely random bonus that only works occasionally. This
is in stark contrast with Limit Breaks in Final Fantasy VII, where charging them
up was one of techniques to help with boss fights.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the game that I also found slightly disappointing is the
music. As usually it was composed by Nobuo Uematsu but, compared to his other
works, music in FFIX feels very average. There are memorable themes once in a
while - Freya’s theme is a masterpiece! - but the music tracks player gets to
hear most often - battle theme, boss theme, world map theme - are meh.
Apparently some music tracks are adaptations of themes from Final Fantasies I,
II, and III, but I haven’t played those entries yet and only realized this from
reading the internet.</p>
<p>As with other Final Fantasy games, this one also has a lot of sidequests. I
have to admit I spectacularly missed some of them, including all Chocobo quests.
I also completely ignored the existence of Tetra Master mini card game, which I
found quite confusing and didn’t bother to search for rule explanation online.
Despite that the game took me 47 hours start to finish, which is more than it
took me to beat Final Fantasy VII when I replayed it four years ago. I played
most of Final Fantasy IX by emulating on Recalbox with RGB Dual. As outlined
<a href="https://jstolarek.github.io/posts/2022-12-26-recalbox-rgb-dual-some-impressions-after-six-months-of-usage.html">in my earlier
post</a>
I’ve run into performance problems, especially on the world map. I won’t hide
this hindered my experience and was one of the reasons I wasn’t keen on
exploring the world if I didn’t have to. For the last quarter of the game I
transferred the save file to my PS Vita, which required using online save
converter since the memory card format is different on the Vita, and played
while on a Christmas holiday trip. I gotta say this was a pretty fun thing to
do. I love how emulation and modding allow to achieve things not possible with
original hardware.</p>
<p>Well, that was quite a bit of complaining on my side. But do I regret playing?
Absolutely not! The story, characters, and the presented world make up for all
the shortcomings of battle system and unexceptional skill system. This is
definitely a good entry in the series and I am very happy to have finally played
it. I regret that I was unable to play FFIX 20 years ago when it came out. But
even playing it now was an unforgettable experience.</p>
