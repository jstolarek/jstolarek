<p>I have quite a lengthy wishlist of computer games I am awaiting to be released.
And when one of these games is finally published what typically happens is that
I don’t have the time to play it because, well, adult life. But not this time.
Firmament, a new game by Cyan, was released two weeks ago and I jumped right
into it. Cyan is a studio that’s been around since the late 80s, and when you
think of it this in itself is a remarkable achievement<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. They are most
famously known for the Myst series, which I am ashamed to admit I have not
played (yet?). But I did play their previous game, Obduction, and it was
remarkable. I was impatiently awaiting Firmament in hope of getting more of the
same. I finished Firmament today and sadly didn’t exactly get what I was hoping
for, but it definitely wasn’t a bad experience either.</p>
<p>Just like all games made by Cyan, Firmament is a game where you explore
stunningly beautiful worlds, discover their story, and solve environmental
puzzles. In Firmament there are three main Realms. Firstly, mountainous and
icy Curievale:</p>

<p>Then there’s lush St. Andrews with its conservatory:</p>

<p>And rocky Juleston where you’ll find an array of electrical batteries and a
sulphur processing facility:</p>

</figure>
</center>
<p>Finally there’s The Swan, a tiny hub world that allows you to travel between the
Realms:</p>

</figure>
</center>
<p>Each world also contains an Arch, a sky-reaching metallic construction, as well
as a tower. You play the role of a Keeper and your task will be to raise these
towers from beneath the surface and get to their tops. You do this using a tool
called the Adjunct that allows you to manipulate surrounding environment by
connecting to sockets located on doors, lifts, and other mechanical devices.</p>
<p>Firmament has three core elements that make up the experience. Firstly, there
are the visuals, which wowed me from the first minutes of the game. In case the
screenshots above weren’t enough here are a few more:</p>

<p>One of Cyan’s trademarks is their design of steampunk machines and environments,
and Firmament delivers on that front. However, while all the Realms are
beautiful, they are also quite similar to each other in that they are all worlds
filled with nature and similarly looking devices. This is a huge step back
compared to Obduction, where all the worlds were truly distinct from one
another.</p>
<p>The second element of the experience are puzzles. They form core part of the
gameplay. Unfortunately this is where Firmament should have been a lot better.
There were few puzzles that I really liked: ones where the rules of the puzzle
and its goal are easy to understand, but the solution itself requires thinking.
Unfortunately, most of the puzzles don’t fall into that category, having all
sorts of design problems. Some puzzles were tedious: I knew the solution but
was forced to walk back and forth to implement it. Others were totally obscure
and I solved them with trial and error. One of the reviews I saw online
compared the puzzles to towers of Hanoi, and that’s an accurate comparison.
Even if I knew what needed to be done, actually doing it often required lots
back and forth attempts. Again, Obduction had much better puzzles, especially
those that required combining elements between various worlds.</p>
<p>The last part of the experience is the plot, and this is what Firmament does
very poorly. In Obduction there was lots of environmental storytelling and many
bits and pieces to put together, allowing to recreate what has actually
happened. Granted, Obduction’s storytelling wasn’t perfect - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1186090336">a kind soul went
through the effort of explaining everything for those who got
lost</a> - but
it was much better than what Firmament has to offer. In Firmament the player is
accompanied by Mentor, an avatar who acts as a narrator and tells successive
parts of the story as player progresses through the game. And that’s it.
There’s nothing to be figured out from the environment, nothing for the player
to piece together.</p>
<p>I also have to mention technical problems of Firmament. After the release many
people complained about getting softlocked due to puzzle bugs, or narrator voice
completely disappearing after certain point in the game. I was spared these
issues, but my playthrough was plagued by repeated crashes to the desktop:</p>
<center>

A sadly common sight.

<p>If I was lucky crash to desktop would happen once an hour. If I was less lucky
I would experience seven crashes in 30 minutes. I reported these bugs to Cyan
support, but to this day these crashes have not been fixed. They are the
primary reason why it took me 2 weeks to finish a game that ultimately takes
less than 8 hours to play. I also have to mention the menus. While the game
visuals are stunning, the menus look like prototypes that made it into
production:</p>
<center>
<figure>

<p>Menu’s are not the most important thing, but they certainly make for a bad first
impression of the game.</p>
<p>My overall impressions of Firmament are good, but aside from the visuals it
certainly is a step back compared to Obduction. If you haven’t played any game
from Cyan and would like to give it a try, Obduction would definitely be my
recommendation, not Firmament. And if you want to give Firmament a try I
recommend waiting for more bugfixes and a sale.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I just finished reading Jason Schreier’s book <em>“Press Reset: Ruin and
Recovery in the Video Game Industry”</em> which is exactly on the topic of
game studios getting closed all the time and often for no good reason.
Great book, highly recommended.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
