<p>In the past couple of months I have been indulging in buying all sorts of retro
stuff from Japan, mostly artbooks, laserdiscs and games. Though I don’t
understand Japanese, at least to an extent that would allow me to fully enjoy
purchased goods, I thought it would be nice to have Japanese releases of some of
my favourite games. The primary motivation is that European and US editions
tend to be prohibitively expensive these days, whereas releases from Japan tend
to be rather cheap - quite understandably, given the language barrier.</p>
<p>While browsing shopping sites for retro games - I happen to have an NTSC-J
version of Sega Saturn - I often run into obscure games that were never released
outside of Japan. Typically, I then search online for information on what these
unknown games even are. A page that comes up very frequently in search results
is <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>, which seems to
specialize in all sorts of niche games from all eras. I was then very pleased
to learn that Hardcore Gaming 101 also publishes books, one of them being
<a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/books/hg101-presents-japanese-video-game-obscurities/">“Japanese Video Game
Obscurities”</a>
by Kurt Kalata, published in 2019. Once I learned of its existence, I knew I
need to have it.</p>

<p>The book contains reviews of 101 games, the majority of which were not
officially released outside of Japan. The focus is on retro titles for both
consoles and PCs, with most of the reviewed games being released in the 90s, but
also some titles from 80s and 2000s. Reviews are grouped into chapters by
genre, with each review taking two pages: one page for the review itself and one
for the screenshots.</p>

<p>As you can see in the photos above, the reviews are short, yet they are
unbelievably succinct. In just a few paragraphs of text, they convey
surprisingly large amounts of information and insight, both about the game
itself and the context surrounding it. Each review offers multiple trails of
further research, typically on the studio’s previous and future titles, similar
games, and artists involved.</p>
<p>If you are interested in retro gaming and enjoy learning about games that didn’t
make it to the West, then “Japanese Video Game Obscurities” is a must-read. It
is well researched, writing is top quality, and choice of screenshots is very
good. The only real complaint I have about the book is the lack of an
alphabetic index of titles, forcing the reader to search the (non-alphabetic)
table of contents when looking for a particular game. Also, the illustration on
the cover looks quite amateurish. That’s not a serious complaint, though
— just don’t let the cover mislead you.</p>
