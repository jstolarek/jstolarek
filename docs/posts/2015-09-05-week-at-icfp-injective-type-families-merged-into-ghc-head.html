        <h1 id="week-at-icfp-injective-type-families-merged-into-ghc-head">Week at ICFP: Injective Type Families merged into GHC HEAD</h1>
<p>I spent last week at Vancouver, Canada attending Haskell Implementors Workshop,
ICFP and the Haskell Symposium. Yesterday I gave a talk on injective type
families, <a href="../posts/2015-05-26-injective-type-families-for-haskell.html">described also in my previous post</a>.
<a href="http://ics.p.lodz.pl/~stolarek/_media/pl:research:injectivity-haskell15-slides.pdf">Slides are on my web page</a>
but the talk itself is not yet online. Day prior to the talk I finally managed
to <a href="https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/374457809de343f409fbeea0a885877947a133a2">merge the injective type families
branch</a>,
which means that this feature is definitely making it into the next stable
release of GHC. (In case you havenâ€™t heard this will be GHC 8.0, not 7.12.)</p>
<p>My next plans include extending injective type families to fully match
expressiveness of functional dependencies, as outlined in Section 7.2 of the
injectivity paper. I also hope to finally implement <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/10267">support for typed holes in
Template Haskell</a>. The patch was
supposed to be trivial and I started working on it several months ago. But then
I ran into several problems with it and abandoned it to focus on ITFs.</p>
