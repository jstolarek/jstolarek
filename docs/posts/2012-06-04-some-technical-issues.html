<p>I’ve been reported that some people experience technical issues with my blog and in fact I experienced them myself. The common problem is that sometimes a particular post won’t load. Instead you get a RSS feed. Reloading the page doesn’t help in any way. I don’t know what’s causing the issue, but it’s certainly not browser-specific. Googling suggests that it might be problem with hosting but I wasn’t able to pin the problem yet. The only solution that seems to work is cleaning the cookies and then reloading the page (at least it worked for me). If anyone has any suggestion regarding this I’ll be glad to hear them.</p>
<p>It also happened to me twice that I got a listing of directory on the server instead of the actual web page. This is definitely issue on the server side. Reloading the page solves the problem.</p>
