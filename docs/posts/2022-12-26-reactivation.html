<p>I’ve been meaning to write this post for quite some time and now I finally have
some time to do it during Christmas break. My blog has been inactive for the
past six years, coming to a complete stop when I moved to Edinburgh in 2016.
Reasons behind this are quite simple: I had more research work on my head at the
University of Edinburgh. This resulted in me having less time and interest in
blogging.</p>
<p>A year ago I made a decision to return to Poland. Last year at this time I was
finishing my preparations to leave the UK. This was a hectic time and I’m glad
I won’t have to move between countries in any foreseeable future. Decision to
return to my home country was combined with changing jobs. I left the academia
and moved to the industry to work as a Haskell developer. As part of that
process I had to salvage my blog posts which were still stored in a dilapidated
Wordpress instance on my University’s server. It was tedious but after several
evenings I had all the posts as Markdown files, my homepage now rewritten to use
Hakyll and moved to GitHub pages.</p>
<p>In the past weeks and months I’ve been thinking about returning to blogging.
It’s time to reactivate this blog, if only for a bit. I just need a place where
I can share/dump/record my thoughts on various things I’m into these days. This
means that posts will likely not focus on functional programming. Expect
writeups on retro hardware and all sort of games. The decision to reactivate my
blog was largely inspired by <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard’s fantastic
blog</a>. I have no ambition to provide as good
technical insights as he does - though who knows, maybe one day? - but seeing
how he combines technical and casual posts in a single blog gave me the courage
to resume blogging.</p>
<p>I also decided I’m keeping the name - Yet Another Lambda Blog - though the
amount of lambdas might be much lower than it used to be in the past.</p>
