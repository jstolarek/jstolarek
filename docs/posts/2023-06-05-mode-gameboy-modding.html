        <h1 id="more-gameboy-modding">More GameBoy modding</h1>
<p>Since my previous post about modding a GameBoy Color, back in January, I have
modded three more GameBoys: a GameBoy Pocket, an original GameBoy DMG, and a
GameBoy Advance. I want to talk about the first two today, leaving the third
one for later.</p>
<h2 id="gameboy-pocket">GameBoy Pocket</h2>
<p>I already have one modded GameBoy Pocket, but I wanted to make another one for
my wife. I got a donor GBP with a damaged screen that had a wide black stripe
running from top to bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Modding GBP is very similar to GBC, so it went pretty smooth. Similary to GBC,
I trimmed the cartridge slot pins and secured them with kapton tape.</p>
<p>When I was making the NES-themed GBC I reported how replacing the speaker with a
new one resulted in no sound. I don’t know why that was the case but back then
I just restored the old speaker. I decided to try using this remaining
replacement speaker in this build and it worked without any problems. I have no
clue what I did wrong with the GBC.</p>
<p>When installing the screen I always have a dillema whether to use the provided
3M dust seal. The supposed advantage of using if is that it should provide
protection against dust getting between the screen and the lens<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. A clear
disadvantage is that once the screen is glued to the seal it cannot be removed
with being destroyed, and it cannot be even adjusted in any way. This time I
decided to use the seal, which required cutting small fragments on the side so
that it fits in the shell.</p>
<p>And here’s the lens and the screen already installed:</p>
<p>Finally, there’s some more soldering required. One contact on the ribbon cable
must be soldered to the power switch in order to provide enough power for the
screen, while another is used to solder a touch sensor. With these finished I
was ready to assemble the console. Here are a couple of photos of the finished
build.</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t go quite right is the centering of the screen. The photos
don’t show this well, but the screen is slightly shifted to the left so that the
left edge of the displayed image is covered. And since the screen is now glued
to the seal it’s not possible to adjust it. I might decide to fix this one day
at the expense of sacrificing a screen, which are not that expensive.</p>
<h2 id="gameboy-dmg">GameBoy DMG</h2>
<p>I also have one modded original GameBoy (these are referred to as DMG) in my
collection. This was an already made build I got from eBay shortly before
returning from the UK to Poland. I knew GameBoys will be harder to find in
Poland - well, not really harder to find, just more expensive - so I decided to
get one that’s already modded since I didn’t have the time to mod it myself.
However, I wasn’t entirely happy with how that GameBoy looks. I could have just
replaced the shell with a new one, but I figured it would be more fun just to
get a new GameBoy DMG and mod it myself. As expected, GameBoys in Poland are
expensive so I got one from Sweden since it was cheaper (sic!). The unit was
sold as faulty/not working, but I don’t really believe in such a thing as a
broken GameBoy. Like, there is a GameBoy that literally <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/8ifqbp/gameboy_at_nintendo_nyc_store_damaged_in_bombing/">survived a bombing
during the Gulf War and it still
works</a>.
So I just assumed there is simply no way that a DMG can’t be fixed.</p>
<p>When the unit arrived it had a missing lens, damage on the screen, and since of
spilled acid in the battery compartment.</p>
<p>I put in the batteries and - surprise, surprise - it didn’t power on. Well, the
seller wasn’t lying. I thought this must have something to do either with
corrosion from spilled batteries or the power switch. My first debugging step
was to check continuity between the battery contacts.</p>
<p>In the photo above my multimeter shows no continuity between the spring and a
metal plate that spring is attached to. Looks like the acid must have gotten
between the plate and the spring causing corrosion. The easiest way to test
whether this is indeed the problem was transferring the main board to a new
shell.</p>
<p>I inserted the batteries, turned the console on, and it Just Worked. So the
problem was with the damaged contacts from spilled batteries. I was glad this
went so easily. If the problem was indeed with the power switch this repair
would have gotten much more difficult.</p>
<p>The DMG actually consists of two boards. One is the main board with a CPU -
that’s the one in photo above - while the other connects to the screen and also
contains button contacts. Installing a new IPS panel requires replacing the
other board with a new one. It also requires soldering a speaker and this is
the only soldering required by this mod.</p>
<p>With the speaker in place I tested everything to make sure that both the speaker
and the screen work as expected.</p>
<p>I was no ready to install the screen and the lens, and assemble everything
together. This kit comes with a very nice mounting bracket for the screen. It
fits very tightly, ensuring that the screen is correctly centered. It also
covers components on the ribbon cable so there is no need to secure them with
Kapton tape as I did in my other GameBoys.</p>
<p>One minor issue that appeared during the final assembly was insufficient number
of screws to attach the screen and button board to the shell. Eight are
required but the kit came with only six. My solution was to use the screews
from original GameBoy, though these turned out to be slightly too long. This
build was surprisingly quick, taking me less than two hours. I am very happy
with the end result, though as usual top and bottom of the IPS panel stand out
from under the lens and this is clearly visible in a transparent shell.</p>
<p>While doing the final tests I discovered one small issue. With this kit the
contrast wheel is repurposed to adjust screen settings: brightness, colour, and
retro pixel mode. I realized that this wheel is being pressed agains the shell
and gets stuck in one position.</p>
<p>My conjecture is that the problem is caused by the two missing screws mentioned
above. I used the six screews provided with the kit around the button contacts.
From my experience getting the board to fight tightly around the contacts is
crucial for the buttons to work correctly. The two missing screws that I
replaced using screws from the original unit were placed below the screen. As
already mentioned, these screws were a bit too long and didn’t hold the board as
tightly as screws provided with the kit. My guess is that if the board had a
tighter fight there it wouldn’t press the contrast wheel against the shell and
all would work as expected. My ad-hoc solution to this was slightly loosening
two of the screws that hold the shell together. Now the contrast wheel can mobe
freely, while the shell still remains nicely fitted.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, I have also modded a GameBoy Advance
using a TFT panel that I have not used before. I want to spend more time using
it before writing about it. I also have a GameBoy Advance SP waiting to be
modded, but for now I can’t find a shell that I would be happy with, and I can’t
decide what kind of screen to use - a TFT panel mentioned above or a regular IPS
panel? Once I do more testing with the TFT panel I should be able to decide
what components I want to use with the SP. Last but not least, I have a NeoGeo
Pocket Color. Recently I managed to buy a flashcart for it and now the only
thing it needs to be really usable is a new screen. However, modding GBA SP and
NGPC might have to wait for a few months due to financial reasons.</p>
