Theoretical properties of the lattice structure are discussed in detail. An algorithm for converting the lattice structure to a wavelet filter bank coefficients is constructed. A theoretical proof demonstrating that filters implemented by the lattice structure fulfil conditions imposed on an orthogonal wavelet filter bank is conducted."
