	abstract = "This paper introduces a new method for adaptive synthesis of a wavelet transform using fast neural network with topology based on lattice structure. Lattice structure and orthogonal lattice structure are presented and their properties are discussed. A novel method for unsupervised training of the neural network is introduced. Proposed approach is tested by synthesizing new wavelets with expected energy distribution between low- and high-pass filters. Energy compaction of proposed method and Daubechies wavelets is compared. Tests are performed using sound and image signals."
