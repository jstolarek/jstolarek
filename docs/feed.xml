        <h1 id="my-favourite-bands-are-coming-back-to-life-and-i-love-it">My favourite bands are coming back to life and I love it</h1>
<p>My late teens and early 20s have been a formative period for my musical taste.
It was back then when I started listening to hardcore/punk rock and its
derivatives such as metalcore and, most importantly of all, post-hardcore. The
latter is a broad genre and many bands have received a post-hardcore label, but
my top favourites are Alexisonfire<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and From Autumn to Ashes.</p>
<p>From my perspective, years between 2003 and 2005 feel like a golden period of
music. If I were to make a list of great albums released in those years, I
could easily pick at least fifty. Sadly, as time went on, most of the bands I
liked either officially disbanded or silently went on an indefinite hiatus.
Reasons were many: starting a family and living a life, working on another
musical project, or sometimes an argument within a band that made former friends
part their ways. This always made me sad, but I learned to move on and just
enjoy the old recordings.</p>
<p>But in recent years I am seeing a reverse trend: many bands that were at their
peak 20 years ago are now re-forming and recording new music. I am not sure why
that is happening, though the collective loneliness and uncertainty of the
pandemic seems to have been a contributing factor in at least some of the cases.
In this post, I want to highlight three new records from the last two years that
have been extremely pleasant surprises for me. Perhaps you will enjoy them too.</p>
<h2 id="intermission-bandcamp-is-doing-music-distribution-the-right-way">Intermission: Bandcamp is doing music distribution the right way</h2>
<p>I like buying physical album releases, but since I don’t have enough space to
store all the music that I listen to, I also like the idea of digital
distribution. However, execution of that idea is often poor, either because of
DRM or because music is being provided as a service. In both cases, one does
not receive ownership of what one pays for. To me, that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is an online music distribution platform, that truly sells music -
both in digital form and on physical media. If you purchase an album or a track
you get to download it DRM-free in any of the most popular audio formats (MP3,
FLAC, OGG, WAV, AAC, ALAC, AIFF). Importantly, Bandcamp also allows you to
listen to albums for free before making a purchase. Hence, most links in this
post will lead you to Bandcamp.</p>
<p>In the past year, I’ve fallen in love with Bandcamp and now use it to make
almost all of my music purchases<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Bandcamp isn’t yet as big and popular as
Spotify, so not all bands can be found there. Luckily for me, the ones I care
about are mostly there.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the music.</p>
<h2 id="otherness-by-alexisonfire"><em>Otherness</em> by Alexisonfire</h2>
<p>Alexisonfire is a post-hardcore band from Canada. They are one of my favourite
bands and I can’t help but truly appreciate their official website address,
<a href="https://theonlybandever.com/">theonlybandever.com</a>. The band released four
full-length albums between 2001 and 2008. They disbanded in 2010 and the
members went to play in various other bands (Gallows, City And Colour, Black
Lungs). If I were to pick Alexisonfire’s best album, I would have a hard time
deciding between <a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/watch-out"><em>Watch
Out!</em></a> and
<a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/crisis"><em>Crisis</em></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>In June 2022 Alexisonfire released a new album called
<a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/otherness"><em>Otherness</em></a>. It wasn’t
entirely unexpected since in 2019 the band released two new songs, <a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/familiar-drugs">Familiar
Drugs</a> and
<a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/complicit">Complicit</a>, followed by one
more song, <a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/album/season-of-the-flood">Season Of The
Flood</a>, in early
2020.</p>
<p>One characteristic thing about Alexisonfire is that each of their albums
maintains the band’s characteristic style, but at the same time has its own
uniqueness that sets it apart. This is also true for <em>Otherness</em>, with the
album being noticeably calmer and slower than the earlier ones. While I prefer
faster music, <em>Otherness</em> is a real joy to listen to. I also appreciate the
band experimenting with new sounds, such as in the song <a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/track/dark-night-of-the-soul">Dark Night Of The
Soul</a>. If I
were to recommend one song from <em>Otherness</em> it would be <a href="https://alexisonfire.bandcamp.com/track/reverse-the-curse">Reverse The
Curse</a>.</p>

<figcaption>
The physical version of the album comes with a lyrics booklet.

</div>
<p>I also highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WOyIMbk_as">Alexisonfire’s House of Strombo
concert</a> on YouTube. It is under
40 minutes and contains music from all periods of their career.</p>
<h2 id="endless-by-leiah"><em>Endless</em> by Leiah</h2>
<p>Leiah is an emo band from Sweden, that released four records (EP + three albums)
between 1999 and 2003 and then went completely silent. Note that when I say
“emo” I don’t mean the kind of emo that became popular mainstream in the
mid-late 2000s. Rather, Leiah follows in the footsteps of bands such <a href="https://sunnydayrealestate.bandcamp.com">Sunny Day
Real Estate</a> or Mineral. While Leiah
was never at the top of my favourite bands, they are certainly a band that I
like and enjoy listening to. Especially in winter.</p>
<p>Leiah was always a band I found quite cryptic. For long, long years there was
no information about them available online: no Wikipedia page, no social media,
nothing available on the streaming services, no online search results. It was
as if the band never existed. Things changed in January 2018, when the band
opened an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/leiah026/">Instagram account</a>, released
<a href="https://leiah.bandcamp.com/">remastered versions</a> of their first three albums,
and went on a tour in 2019. I wasn’t aware of this return to activities and
only learned about it when Leiah released their new album, called
<a href="https://thirtysomethingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/endless"><em>Endless</em></a>, in
January 2023. As such, it took me completely by surprise - a very pleasant
surprise, I must add.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><em>Endless</em> is 39 minutes long and features ten songs. The music is similar in
style to Leiah’s earlier releases, but at the same time it feels genuinely fresh
and new. It is a comeback that is so good it almost feels unreal. If I were to
recommend one song from the new album, it would be
<a href="https://thirtysomethingrecords.bandcamp.com/track/surrender">Surrender</a>.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<figcaption>
The physical release comes with four bonus tracks (14 total). Sadly, no lyrics booklet.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When it comes to Leiah’s older songs, I highly recommend
<a href="https://leiah.bandcamp.com/track/week-end">Week-End</a> from the album
<a href="https://leiah.bandcamp.com/album/surrounded-by-seasons"><em>Surrounded by
Seasons</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-revealing-by-stretch-arm-strong"><em>The Revealing</em> by Stretch Arm Strong</h2>
<p>Stretch Arm Strong is an American melodic hardcore band, that released five
full-length albums between 1998 and 2005. The last one, <em>Free at Last</em>, is a
real masterpiece. Again, the band was almost completely silent for nearly two
decades. And then in March this year - 2024, in case you’re reading this in the
future - they released a new EP.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2024-05-29-my-favourite-bands-are-coming-back-to-life-and-i-love-it/the_revealing.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2024-05-29-my-favourite-bands-are-coming-back-to-life-and-i-love-it/the_revealing_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>
<em>The Revealing</em> cover.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With six songs, <em>The Revealing</em> is only 14 minutes long. This might not seem
like much, but the songs are really great. They are fast, aggressive, and full
of positive energy. While many bands drift towards softer music as they age,
this is certainly not the case here. <em>The Revealing</em> is pure energy, and I’ve
been listening to it several times a day for the past two weeks. If I were to
recommend just one song from the EP it would be <a href="https://stretcharmstrongsc.bandcamp.com/track/still-believe-part-iii">Still Believe, Part
III</a>.</p>
<p>My only complaint about <em>The Revealing</em> is that, as of the moment of this
writing, the CD version of the album is not available in Europe, leaving the
option of purchasing either a digital version or a vinyl.</p>
<p>I also note that while Stretch Arm Strong has re-issued two of their old albums
on vinyls, these albums cannot be purchased digitally on Bandcamp. Their
digital versions are only available as a bonus if you purchase the vinyl
release, which is a huge shame.</p>
<h2 id="still-waiting-for">Still waiting for…</h2>
<p>All the three releases above are great albums that brought me a lot of joy.
While over the years I experimented with new bands and genres, I still come back
to my favourite bands from two decades ago. Their music has a special place in
my heart and I am truly happy to see some of them come back to life.</p>
<p>I hope this is not the end of it. At this point, my biggest hopes are for a new
album from <a href="https://fromautumntoashes.bandcamp.com">From Autumn To Ashes</a>. In
the past few years, the band has been actively touring and releasing their
previous albums on vinyls. A new album feels like a next logical step. I keep
my finger crossed.</p>

The music is not organized by bands but rather by copyright owners. Sure,
you will see all albums of a band available on a single profile. But it
is also common to have albums of an artist sold across multiple different
profiles, often grouped with other artists signed to the same record
label. A good example is Shai Hulud, which has two different artist
profiles: one for <a href="https://shaihulud.bandcamp.com/music">albums released by Revelation
Records</a> and one for albums
<a href="https://shaihuludofficial.bandcamp.com/music">released by Metal Blade
Records</a>. The good news is
that once you purchase an album, it simply becomes available in your
collection and all that mess becomes irrelevant.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

        <h1 id="installing-an-ips-screen-in-a-neogeo-pocket-color">Installing an IPS-screen in a NeoGeo Pocket Color</h1>
<p>About a year ago I bought two rather obscure handheld consoles: a NeoGeo Pocket
Color (NGPC) and a WonderSwan Color (WSC). Both were competitors to the GameBoy
Color (GBC) and both lost. Due to their smaller popularity they are not as well
known as the GameBoy and also command higher prices today, since there were
fever of them produces. Also, neither the NGPC nor the WSC had a backlit
screen, so in order to be used comfortably they need an IPS mod. Today I will
write about installing a modern IPS panel in the NGPC.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/original_screen_1.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/original_screen_1_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Before moving on there’s an important disclaimer. NeoGeo Pocket comes in three
versions. There’s the original NeoGeo Pocket with a monochrome screen. It was
on the market for about a year (1998-1999) and never officially left Japan.
Then there is the NeoGeo Pocket Color that I will be talking about in this post.
It was distributed worldwide, even if only for a couple of months, but mine is a
Japanese unit. Finally, there’s a smaller version of NGPC, officially known as
the New NeoGeo Pocket Color. These days people commonly refer to it as NGPC
Slim. Due to smaller size NGPC Slim is more difficult to mod.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-mod">About the mod</h2>
<p>When modding the GameBoys I usually rely on parts from FunnyPlaying. However,
they only offer mods for the GameBoys. Looking at the online retro communities
it seems that when it comes to the NeoGeo Pocket people tend to order from the
<a href="https://pl.aliexpress.com/store/5374188">Cloud Game Store</a> on AliExpress. And
so I bought from them an IPS panel mod as well as a new replacement shell. The
choice of shells isn’t great to be honest. I went with a transparent black
shell and also ended up installing original black buttons from my console,
instead of clear transparent ones that came with the kit. Moreover, both the
IPS panel and the shell are noticeably more expensive than in case of the
GameBoys.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<h2 id="installing-the-screen">Installing the screen</h2>
<p>For the most part installation is straightforward. First step is disassembly:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/ngpc_disassembly_1.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/ngpc_disassembly_1_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The first tricky bit is the metal cover separating the cartridge slot and the
main board. The one that comes with the kit doesn’t fit the shell very well so
I had to re-use the original one. However, reusing original screws was not a
good idea, as the screw holes are significantly smaller on the replacement
shell.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/slot_cover.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/slot_cover_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>

<figcaption>
Original screws are too big for the new shell and it just cracks.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Installing the screen itself turned out to be tricky. There is no spacing
bracket so one has to rely on a small plastic spacer and a piece of foam
provided with the kit. This is far from perfect. There is also a dust seal to
be used to permanently attach the IPS panel to the shell. However, the IPS
panel is quite narrow and so it only attaches to the top and bottom of the seal,
making it possible for the dust to come in from the sides. Also, at first I
couldn’t figure out the orientation of the panel, since it’s nearly square is
shape.</p>

<p>The board needs to be powered directly from the battery, which is done with an
extra wire. Installation instructions say to just wrap the wire around the
battery contact, but I decided to solder it contact point on the board instead.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/power_wire.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2024-01-21-installing-ips-screen-in-ngpc/power_wire_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

touch sensor at the top.

</figure>
</div>
<p>With the power wire in place the shell is ready for final assembly. At this
point the touch sensor needs to carefully aligned so that it touches the top of
the shell. It will allow adjusting the brightness as well as selecting one of
several available scanline modes. There are horizontal and vertical ones, as
well as a retro-pixel grid. Personally, I found scanlines to be way too dark so
I have them turned off. It is also possible to switch the screen to a
monochrome mode.</p>
<p>Here’s the finished build:</p>

screws.</li>

<li><p>In order to get the speaker to fit I had to remove its metal protective
cover.</p></li>
<li><p>I messed up when attaching the lens and left a fingerprint underneath it.
What I learned is that once the lens is removed with a suction cup it can
be attached again, so I was able to get that fingerprint removed without
having to get a new lens.</p></li>
<li><p>I am yet to determine the battery life of the modded system. I had the
console power off without a warning a couple of times. The original system
supposedly runs for as long as 40 hours on a pair of AA batteries, but an
IPS panel and a flashcart certainly reduce that time. I hope this
unexpected powering off isn’t a sign of a deeper problem.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Over the course of time I was able to get a couple of original games for the
system (sadly, cartridges only - no boxes) but I also got a <a href="https://www.retrotowers.co.uk/flash-carts/neopocket-gamedrive">NeoPocket
GameDrive</a>
flashcart. Without a flashcart it’s really difficult to enjoy the system since
the game prices for NGPC are very high. Compared to the Everdrive cartridges
from Krikzz, the GameDrive is moderately convenient to use. It has 15MB of
flash memory and the games need to be loaded from an SD card into that memory
before they can be played. Once a game is loaded it stays in flash until you
delete it. 15 MB is enough to store several games, but the flashing process is
very slow, so if you want to play multiple titles you might find yourself
waiting quite a lot.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves I was afraid that NGPC will be nothing more than an
expensive curiosity, but it actually has quite a lot to offer. At least for a
NeoGeo MVS fan like myself. I spent a lot of time playing arcade titles such as
Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and The Last Blade. All of these
titles have their NGPC ports, though calling them “ports” is a bit of a stretch.
Today we would call them demakes. Regardless of how we call them however, they
are a blast to play. I was genuinely surprised that despite simple graphics -
the character sprites consist of only three colours - The Last Blade plays just
like in the arcade version. Same goes for King of Fighters and SNK vs. Capcom.
These games are so enjoyable not only because of how responsive they are and how
accurately they recreate the arcade feel of original titles, but also thanks to
the joystick that the NGPC uses. Instead of the usual D-pad the console has a
small, clicky joystick, and that joystick makes it possible to easily execute
all the tricky inputs required in fighting games. This is in stark contrast
with, say, GameBoy Advance, which offers arcade-perfect ports of King of Fighters
games, but the D-pad makes it nearly impossible to reliably execute any special
moves.</p>
<p>Also I’d love to be able to play some fighting games in the Versus mode between
two consoles. This doesn’t seem likely though, given that link cables to
connect two consoles are practically unavailable on the second-hand market. And
when they are they sell for well over a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>That being said, I will certainly be looking to get one more NeoGeo Pocket, this
time possibly a Slim variant. This console has certainly turned out to be much
more than I expected.</p>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This post is not intended to serve as installation tutorial.

<p>I recently wrote about <a href="2023-11-30-installing-a-gcloader-in-my-gamecube.html">installing a GCLoader in a GameCube I
own</a>, but on the same day
I also installed two additional mods in my PlayStation: an <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/sony-playstation-x-reset-mod-kit/">X-Reset
mod</a>
and a <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/sony-playstation-dual-frequency-oscillator-mod-kit/">DFO
mod</a>,
both purchased from <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/">Consoles Unleashed</a>.</p>

<h2 id="x-reset">X-Reset</h2>
<p>I already <a href="2023-03-35-installing-xstation.html">installed XStation in my PSX</a>,
which is an optical drive emulator (ODE) that allows launching games from ISO
images stored on an SD card. While it’s super convenient to have all games on a
single memory card, there was a minor usability issue related to using XStation.
Resetting the console to return to XStation’s game selection menu required
physically pushing button on the console. Not a big deal, but somewhat annoying
when you’re sitting on a couch and want to quickly test a bunch of games.
X-Reset fixes that by adding button combinations to the controller that allow to
reset both the game (back to the title screen) and the console (back to
XStation’s game selection menu). Installation of X-Reset requires soldering a
small QSB (quick solder board) to the bottom of the motherboard.</p>

<h2 id="dfo">DFO</h2>
<p>I have a PAL-region console, where the games were timed to run at 50Hz.
Obviously, playing at 60Hz results in smoother experience and a PAL PlayStation
with XStation installed can actually switch to displaying 60Hz signal when
running NTSC games<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, when a PAL console runs an NTSC game the GPU
timings are slightly incorrect, resulting in a refresh rate that’s off by around
1 percent. This is rather unnoticeable, but certain games will not work because
of that difference.</p>
<p>This can be fixed with a DFO mod. DFO stands for Dual Frequency Oscillator. As
the name suggests, it allows to automatically<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> supply different GPU timings
depending on the game region, thus ensuring that games run at correct speed both
in 50Hz and 60Hz.</p>
<p>Installing the mod is a bit tricky. As you can see from the photos below the
mod requires soldering four wires to the motherboard. That’s the simple part.
The difficult part is desoldering a resistor in order to disconnect the GPU from
the original frequency oscillator. That resistor is located under the RF shield
that covers top of the motherboard. The RF shield needs to be desoldered and
this was a difficult task. I was unable to fully desolder it and resorted to
lifting it as much as possible to remove the resistor. It worked, but I can’t
say I felt confident doing that.</p>

<p>Both mods required fairly simple soldering. I’ve certainly done more
complicated mods, but this time something went wrong and I really messed up the
solder joints. They hold, but they don’t turned out the way they should.
Either my soldering iron is giving out or I messed up when using rosin, which I
hadn’t used previously.</p>

    <title>Installing a GCLoader in my GameCube</title>

        <h1 id="installing-a-gcloader-in-my-gamecube">Installing a GCLoader in my GameCube</h1>
<p>I got a GameCube towards the end of my stay in the UK, in late 2021. Right from
the start I wanted to mod it with a
<a href="https://gc-loader.com/product/gc-loader-pnp-hw2/">GCLoader</a>, which is an ODE
(Optical Drive Emulator) that replaces the original DVD drive, but it was
permanently out of stock. This was due to chip shortage caused by the pandemic,
followed by the FPGA chip used in the GCLoader going completely out of
production. As a stop-gap solution I had to install a <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/nintendo-gamecube-region-free-mod-kit/">Xeno
modchip</a>
on the main board of the DVD drive:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-11-30-installing-a-gcloader-in-my-gamecube/modchip.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-11-30-installing-a-gcloader-in-my-gamecube/modchip_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A quick note on the photo above. As you can see the modchip is soldered
directly onto the DVD drive board, exactly as it was designed to be installed.
This required some fine soldering, with some solder points being less than 0,3mm
away from each other. I was advised to install the modchip not by soldering it
onto the board, but by soldering wires onto the contact points on the board and
then connecting these wires to the modchip. I ignored this advice, which I now
regret a bit. Having the modchip on wires would make it trivial to remove it,
and thus allow to easily restore the drive to its original state. De-soldering
the modchip from the board itself is a lot more complicated and I am not going
to risk it.</p>
<p>Installing the modchip allowed me to launch <a href="https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc">Swiss
homebrew</a> from a burned DVD, which then
automatically booted into the latest version of Swiss installed on a microSD
card inside an <a href="https://github.com/citrus3000psi/SD2SP2">SD2SP2 adapter</a>. From
a functionality perspective this setup provided everything I needed.</p>
<p>Recently the GCLoader was redesigned to use the currently available FPGA chip
and the ODE once again became available for purchase. Production batches are
small and they sell out very quickly. Luckily, they are announced in advance
and I managed to grab one unit in early November.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the light of what I said above about the modchip and SD2SP2 setup it is right
to ask whether switching to a GCLoader makes any sense. After all, it doesn’t
provide any new functionality and it takes away the ability to run games from
original discs. Not to mention the cost of the ODE itself. These are all fair
points. However, GameCubes in recent years have seen frequent drive failures
due to decaying capacitors and I wanted to preempt such a failure on my console.
I should probably just recap the drive, but this is something I still don’t feel
confident with and want to avoid recapping if possible.</p>
<p>Installing the GCLoader is simple since it doesn’t require any soldering. All
it takes are a couple of screwdrivers, with the only caveat being the need for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Line_Head_and_Line_Recess">Gamebit</a>
screwdriver.</p>

</div>
<p>The only tricky bit is attaching the GCLoader to a metal plate on which the DVD
drive normally sits (last photo). The screws need to be a bit loose to allow
the GCLoader to move freely. This is because the holes in the plate are larger
than the GCLoader screws and so it is possible to move it around by about 1mm in
each direction. If it is fixed in a position that does not align with the port
on the main board there is a risk that resulting forces will eventually break
the solder points on either the GCLoader or the motherboard. By leaving the
screws slightly loose the GCLoader can easily move to the right position.</p>
<p>And here is the console right before final assembly:</p>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see I installed a 3D printed SD mount on top of the GCLoader. Being
optimistic about the GCLoader availability, I got the SD mount shortly after I
bought the console. The SD mount waited for over two years in my drawer and I
am glad I can finally make use of it. I can’t remember where I bought the SD
mount, but I remember it was quite expensive. However, the plastic is of such a
high quality that I think this expense was fully justified.</p>
<p>After assembling the console I downloaded the latest Swiss and placed it on an
SD card as a <code>boot.iso</code> file. What really surprised me was that Swiss
recognized the outdated firmware of the GCLoader and informed me about the
available update. There is no way the console can download the update since it
has no Internet connectivity<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, but the fact that a sufficiently new version
of Swiss recognizes an outdated firmware is really neat.</p>
<p><strong>(UPDATE 10/12/2023):</strong> I ran into one small problem with the GCLoader, namely
slow loading times. In Swiss, when the game is loaded it is patched on the fly.
I’m not sure why, but that’s how it works. When I was launching the games using
SD2SP2 this patching and loading took around 5-6 seconds. With GCLoader it
takes around 25 seconds, which is noticeably longer. The solution to the
problem was to upgrade firmware from 1.0.1 to latest 1.1.0.BETA release. This
reduces the loading times to around 3 seconds, making the GCLoader slightly
faster than SD2SP2, as it should be.</p>

        <h1 id="proton-is-detrimental-to-linux-as-a-gaming-platform">Proton is detrimental to Linux as a gaming platform</h1>
<h2 id="the-old-days">The old days</h2>
<p>I have this vivid memory stuck in my head. It is late 2010, right at the start
of a cold Polish winter. It is dark and windy outside. I am sitting at my
then-girlfriend’s room with a laptop and playing <a href="https://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the
Titans</a>, a fast-paced tower
defence indie game with a good sense of humour. Most importantly, I am playing
on Linux and the game runs natively.</p>
<p>I bought Revenge of the Titans as part of Humble Indie Bundle 2, a gaming
initiative aiming at rising popularity of indie games, which back in 2010 were
considered more of a curiosity rather than serious gaming experiences. Aside
from the already mentioned Revenge of the Titans, Humble Indie Bundle 2
consisted of five games - Machinarium, Osmos, Cortex Command, and, possibly the
most famous of them all, Braid - that could be purchased by paying as much (or
as little) as one wanted. Perhaps most surprising of all, the games were
available for all desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and were DRM-free.
This was groundbreaking and for me, as a Linux user, being recongnized as a
first-class customer was a big deal.</p>
<p>What did gaming on Linux look like in 2010? Well, it wasn’t great. It was rare
to see a major title ported to Linux, though it did happen. Id Software was at
the forefront of providing quality Linux ports for their games. In fact, one of
the reasons I switched from using Windows to Linux around 2004 was that on my
dated PC Quake III performed better on Linux than it did on Windows. I really
want to stress this: <strong>frame rates were higher on Linux!</strong> In 2010 indie games
had not gained popularity yet, but a handful of titles that existed often had
Linux ports. Finally, there was Wine, which allowed launching some of the
Windows games.</p>
<p>The fact that Humble Indie Bundle provided funding for the developers to port
their games to Linux and macOS<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> felt like an important step towards adopting
Linux as a first-class gaming platform. The future of Linux gaming seemed
bright.</p>
<h2 id="how-proton-eliminated-native-linux-builds">How Proton eliminated native Linux builds</h2>
<p>Fast-forward 13 years to 2023. What does Linux gaming look like today? At
first glance it might seem things got better. Last year Valve, owner of the
world’s most popular gaming platform Steam, released Steam Deck, a Linux-based
portable PC. For years <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ri2nb4/valve_seems_to_do_its_best_to_release_games_on/hov609f/">Valve has pushed for the ability to run Windows games
on Linux</a>.
To this end in 2018 Valve released
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton">Proton</a>, a fork of Wine with a custom
set of patches and a bundle of extra libraries such as
<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk">dxvk</a>. Proton ships with Steam Client and
can be used on Linux to run Windows-only games. There is a set of games that
have been certified to run with Proton, but it is also possible to run games
that received no such certification - you’re just not guaranteed they will
actually run.</p>
<p>This might sound good at first, but for me this push for Proton resulted in
degradation of gaming experience on Linux. First and foremost, <strong>Proton is
closely tied to Steam, and that is a platform I just refuse to use due to its
inherent DRM</strong>. I like to own things I pay for, and that is not the case with
games purchased on Steam. I would lie if I said I have never bought a game on
Steam, but I certainly can’t remember when was the last time I did.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>the existence of Proton became an excuse for the developers not to
publish native Linux ports</strong>. See
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-decks-proton-a-total-war-saga">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/feral-interactive-have-no-plans-to-update-their-linux-ports-for-steam-deck/">here</a>
for examples, and <a href="https://nuclearmonster.com/2021/07/ethan-flibitijibibo-lee-may-retire-from-programming-due-to-valves-proton/">this interview with Ethan
Lee</a>
for some more insights from an experienced Linux porter. I can’t recall when
was the last time I played a non-indie game natively. I think it was Alien:
Isolation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Even indie games, which in the past used to fight for every
customer they can, usually don’t have a Linux port these days or deliver that
port a long time after the game’s original release. One good example is Into
the Breach, a highly-acclaimed indie title which was released in February 2018
and had a Linux port over two years later in April 2020.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Valve has gained quite a big following in certain parts of
the Linux community, and that many people consider the current state of affairs
to be a good one. One of the most commonly seen arguments is: <strong><em>“If a game
runs fine on Proton then there is no point in making a native port”</em>. The
problem with this argument is that the <em>if</em> premise of this statement is
false.</strong> A lot of games do not run well, or at all, with Proton. Moreover, even
if a game runs fine on the release, there is absolutely no guarantee that it
will stay this way. In the past there have been many situations when changes
introduced in a game patch or Proton broke a game.</p>
<p>Proton supposedly can be run without a Steam client, which to some extent would
invalidate my earlier criticism of being tied to one particular storefront.
However, despite multiple attempts, I have never succeeded in doing that. I
tried running Proton standalone, just like I run Wine, as well as using various
frontends such as <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher">Heroic</a>. Every
single time the only result was me wasting several hours of my time. Note that
I am somewhat knowledgeable and have experience with things such as compiling
Wine with custom patches applied to run specific games. I am willing to put the
effort into getting games to run on Linux, but so far I had no success with
Proton and had only wasted my time.</p>
<h2 id="whining-about-wine">Whining about Wine</h2>
<p>Aside from Proton there is also Wine. As typical for an open source project, it
is being distributed through distribution repositories, making it trivial to
install and run. However, gaming experience with Wine is not all that great.</p>
<p>Firstly, Wine suffers from the same problem as Proton, where an update can
completely break a previously working game. My favourite example is Starcraft
II, a major game that has been on the market since 2010 and not long after its
release was marked as <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bShowAll=true&amp;bIsQueue=false&amp;bIsRejected=false&amp;sClass=version&amp;sTitle=&amp;sReturnTo=&amp;iId=20882">Platinum in Wine AppDB compatibility
list</a>.
Since then it has been broken multiple times either by new game patches or
changes to Wine. Just take a look at that compatibility list linked above -
some people rate the game as running perfectly, while others mark it as garbage.
I personally was hit by a patch that broke Starcraft II earlier this year and
was only saved by a determined redditor who found an obscure workaround to the
problem.</p>
<p>Windows compatibility that Wine aims for is a moving target. As such there is
little stability in Wine, and whether things work for you or not is often down
to pure luck. My personal success rate in the last two years is maybe around
30%. The most recent game I tried to run was <a href="2023-10-01-system-shock-remake.html">System Shock
remake</a>. Surely enough, many people report
it as running perfectly out of the box under vanilla Wine, but I had no such
luck and gave up after numerous attempts that took me several hours (around a
third of the time needed to actually finish the game). This is all despite a
hardware configuration that had no problems running the game under Windows at
60FPS on highest detail settings. The best I could get under Wine was running
System Shock in slow motion at around 5 frames per second<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, while Wine is great for preserving old games, it isn’t really a good
gaming platform for currently released games.</p>
<h2 id="better-tomorrow-was-yesterday">Better tomorrow was yesterday</h2>
<p>In this post I only scratched the surface of the problem, but I wanted to get my
opinion out there: <strong>in the long term the existence of Proton hurts Linux as a
gaming platform.</strong></p>
<p>Of course one might ask whether the lack of native ports is really caused by
Valve? Perhaps Linux is too small a market and porting games to it is not
financially viable? When writing this post I read several interviews with indie
developers who release their games on Linux and they all consistently claim that
a Linux release, <em>when done right</em>, is profitable and not a problem to maintain
(see <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/08/07/porting-games-to-linux-is-a-waste-of-time-this-game-developer-says-youre-doing-it-wrong/?sh=7c313d602c16">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/system76/654884924769370112/developing-games-on-linux-an-interview-with">here</a>).</p>
<p>One interesting point I came across while doing research for this post was that
having poorly made Linux ports can be even worse than not having them at all
(for example, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/t2t7ba/a_problem_with_linux_native_ports_and_how_it_may/">this reddit
post</a>).
This is certainly a valid point and I am not arguing for having just any kind of
native ports. I want to see good ones, such as ports released by Id software in
the early 2000s.</p>
<p>All of this is particularly sad, given that creating a native Linux port was
never as easy as it is today. Many game engines support Linux out-of-the-box
and the primary thing a developer needs to do is not shoot themselves in the
foot by using Windows-only middleware. I personally had great experiences with
<a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> language and <a href="https://heaps.io/">heaps.io</a> engine
<a href="https://github.com/jstolarek/ldjam-46">during a game jam</a>, when me and my
friends managed to create builds not only for Windows, Linux, and Mac, but also
a native ARM build for Raspberry Pi. Granted, heaps.io is not a mainstream game
engine, but it has several great success stories, most famous of which is <a href="https://deadcells.com/">Dead
Cells</a>. Most importantly, Unity does support Linux.</p>
<p>I do not have much hope that the trend of not supporting gaming on Linux will
reverse anytime soon. For now I am forced to play on Windows a lot more
frequently than a decade ago, and it feels like a huge step back for Linux.</p>

        <h1 id="salerno-43">Salerno ’43</h1>
<p>In 2023 I finally managed to return to wargaming. This has been an important
hobby of mine for well over a decade now, but I had few playing partners when I
moved abroad. In the past 12 months I not only renewed several of my wargaming
friendships, but also bought a new wargame for the first time in several years.
My choice was <a href="https://www.gmtgames.com/p-868-salerno-43.aspx">Salerno ’43 published by GMT
Games</a> and designed by Mark
Simonitch, a designer whose several games I have played in the past and was
never disappointed with them.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<p>Mark Simonitch is a designer specializing in World War II hex-and-counter games.
His games typically focus on a single military operation lasting several weeks.
His previous games include Ardennes ’44 (Battle of the Bulge in late 1944),
Normandy ’44 (the Allied invasion of France, obviously), France ’40 (German
invasion of Belgium and France as well as Dunkirk evacuation), Holland ’44
(Operation Market Garden), and several others.</p>

</div>
<p>The games often come with several scenarios, one of which is typically a shorter
game that can be played in a couple of hours. Usually there’s also a longer
campaign scenario, which might require more than one playing session to
complete. Of course this isn’t a strict rule. For example both scenarios that
come with France ’40 can be played in under 5 hours, which by wargaming
standards makes for a short game. I personally lean towards these playing
experiences that don’t exceed 5 hours. And so my attention was caught by
Salerno ’43. It is a fairly recent design by Mark Simonitch and it plays on a
very small map - again, by wargaming standards. This suggested a shorter and
simpler game that has a chance of getting to the table more often than it’s
larger siblings.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-25-salerno-43/salerno_43_at_start.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-25-salerno-43/salerno_43_at_start_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Salerno ’43 tells the story of Operation Avalanche, the Allied amphibious
landing near the Italian city of Salerno in September 1943. One player assumes
the role of the defending Germans, the other of the invading American and the
British Commonwealth troops. So far I have only played the short scenario,
which lasts eight turns and, once proficient with the rules, takes around 3
hours to play. There is also a 22-turn campaign scenario, which I am yet to try
out. In all Mark Simonitch’s games the turns are constructed such that one
player moves all his units, then conducts all combats, and then the other player
gets their turn to do the same. Each player’s turn also contains various
“bookkeeping phases”, when players receive reinforcements and check whether
their units are in supply. The actual details are more complicated than that,
but that’s the gist.</p>
<p>Speaking of simplicity, the game isn’t exactly as simple as I had hoped for. I
mean, sure, the map is small. Just look:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-25-salerno-43/salerno_43_map.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-25-salerno-43/salerno_43_map_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>
Playing area is really small.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Not only the map is 22” by 25.5”, instead of the usual 22” by 34”, but also over
a third of the game board is covered by the sea. This makes the playing area
small. The unit density is also fairly low, which is actually one of the
trademarks of Mark Simonitch’s designs. The rules, however, are comparable in
complexity to other, larger titles. One reason for this is the need to cover
the naval invasion and provide mechanics for troops landing on the beaches.
Another chunk of complexity is due to terrain in that area of Italy, which is
mostly hills and mountains, with only a small pocket of plains south of Salerno.
Then there’s a bunch of smaller rules to cover things like aerial and naval
support, naval transport, weather, special units, or rare combat corner cases
such as city battles. All that adds up to a game of rule complexity similar to
previous designs, just with a smaller amount of counters and thus playing a bit
faster. But not much faster if you haven’t internalized the rules and keep
checking them in the rulebook.</p>
<p>An important question when discussing wargames is that of balance, i.e. do both
sides have an equal chance of winning? Of course, when designing wargames that
recreate historical battles this becomes tricky, since many campaigns have been
single-sided. A good example of this is the already mentioned Operation Dynamo
(Dunkirk evacuation) depicted in France ‘40. Historically, this has been a
decisive German victory, though in the end the British managed to successfully
retreat a significant number of the BEF soldiers. And so the game must recreate
that historical imbalance of forces and outcomes, at the same allowing both
players to achieve victory. Otherwise it wouldn’t be a fun game if one player
was doomed to lose from the start. And so play balance is achieved by measuring
players’ effectiveness against their historical counterparts, typically by
assigning victory points (VPs) to certain strategic locations on the map, and
then designing scenarios such that in order to win the players need to reach
these locations in a given time frame.</p>
<p>Salerno ’43 uses this exact solution, but I am not entirely happy with the
resulting gaming experience, at least in the short scenario. In order to win
the Allied player must accumulate at least 8 VPs points by reaching designated
objectives. Here’s how the objectives are laid out on the map - values in red
circles are Victory Points:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I am yet to see a game where the Allies capture Eboli, Nocera Inferiore or
anything north of it. I imagine this could be possible with a combination of
lucky die rolls or German player incompetence, but in the games I played so far
the Allies weren’t even able to approach any of these cities, let alone attempt
to capture them. The remaining objectives total at exactly 8 VPs, leaving the
Allies no room for any strategic decision making. I also note that VPs can be
gained or lost by eliminating certain critical units such as artillery or
beachheads. Artillery losses don’t really happen, but unlucky die rolls can
result in losing a beachhead. In fact same goes for Salerno - it has to be
captured by the Rangers and Commandos on turn one. If that fails, capturing it
later becomes nearly impossible. In other words, with unlucky die rolls on the
first turn leading to not capturing Salerno the fate of the Allied player is
practically sealed.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>That being said, while there isn’t much room for larger strategic decisions in
the short scenario, there are tons of smaller tactical decisions to be made.
And while the broad picture of the invasion was similar in all the games I
played so far, at a tactical level all the games were completely different.
There’s lots of manoeuvring to get units into favourable positions, which is
crucial given the amount of hills and rivers. On that front the game absolutely
delivers, requiring the player to think a lot about how to best utilize
available assets, and demanding some really difficult decisions.</p>
<p>All in all, I did enjoy my games of Salerno ’43. The game isn’t as simple in
terms of rules as I hoped it will be, but small playing area and low unit count
makes for a quick wargaming experience. I also note that history buffs will
spot some minor simplifications that could be seen as historical inaccuracies.
I personally find these absolutely irrelevant.</p>

    <title>LineageOS on Samsung S7&#58; An experience report</title>

        <h1 id="lineageos-on-samsung-s7-an-experience-report">LineageOS on Samsung S7: An experience report</h1>
<p>I don’t have much love for smartphones. While I admit they can be useful at
times, I absolutely detest their ecosystems ‒ both Android and Apple
‒ that primarily exist not to fulfil the needs of the users but those of
the big tech companies. This is a regrettable state of things and any efforts
to change this have not seen widespread success. That being said, a year ago I
decided to run an experiment. Android is after all a free, open-source
software. I thought there should be a way of installing a vanilla version of
Android that lacks Google spyware that manufacturers bundle with the phones.
After exploring the topic I decided to install
<a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>, an Android-based free and open source
operating system for smartphones, on my Samsung S7.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago the said Samsung phone died due to internal memory failure. I
think this is a good moment to share an experience report from a year of using
LineageOS.</p>
<h2 id="android-ecosystem">Android ecosystem</h2>
<p>Vanilla Android is an open source software. If so, then how come it is such a
threat to user’s privacy? Well, that’s because of <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview">Google Play
Services</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, a set of
libraries that phone manufacturers install on retail distributions of Android.
Crucially, many applications require Google Play Services in order to run
correctly. Hence comes the first choice one needs to make when deciding to use
LineageOS. It is possible to use LineageOS without Google Play Services, but
some applications will refuse to work or will experience issues. See
<a href="https://plexus.techlore.tech/">Plexus</a> project for a community-maintained list
of applications. Alternatively, it is possible to install Google Play Services
on LineageOS and have all applications run without problems, but to me this
defeats the purpose of using LineageOS.</p>
<p>There is, however, a third option ‒ an open-source implementation of
Google Play Services known as <a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a>. I did some
superficial reading on microG and concluded that I don’t fully understand how it
works. In particular, I couldn’t figure out how the presence of microG affects
my privacy. As a result I decided to use LineageOS without microG, which is
exactly how LineageOS is distributed by default.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-lineageos">Obtaining LineageOS</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about getting LineageOS onto your phone. Developers maintain <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">a list
of supported devices</a>, for which official
builds are available. The list isn’t short, but don’t be surprised if your
phone is not there. Mine used to be supported at some point in the past, but
that support was dropped due to lack of active maintainer. This presented me
with the first serious problem: how do I obtain an image of LineageOS if it
is not available on the official website?</p>
<p>Technically, there are two solutions. One is to use unofficial ROMs
(i.e. pre-built images) available at the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA
Forums</a>. These images often come with extra
software, most commonly the already mentioned microG or GSF. They are also
often built on a version of Android that is higher than the one officially
available for the phone. However, there is a big issue of trust here. It
generally seems that the uploaded builds are considered trusted, in a sense that
people just trust that the uploaded images are safe. Except there is no way of
really verifying that the images do not contain any malware or spyware or
whatnot. My instinct was not to use those builds.</p>
<p>I was left with the second solution: building the ROM image myself. Since my
phone used to be officially supported there were build instructions available
for it, except they turned out to be highly inaccurate. Long story short, it
took me 3 weeks to solve the problems I was running into while building, which
is more than most users are willing to spend on installing a new system to their
phone. Even worse, after installing my newly-built image it turned out that the
Bluetooth doesn’t work. A case of missing firmware perhaps?</p>
<p>In the end I managed to find an archive of old official LineageOS images located
on a Russian FTP server that also hosted various leaked corporate data and a
North Korean Linux distribution known as RedStar OS. Admittedly, this source
was more dubious than the XDA Forums, but the archive of images looked
legitimate and so I put my security concerns aside. This image turned out to
work without any issues, including the previously broken Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="flashing-os-image-onto-the-phone">Flashing OS image onto the phone</h2>
<p>Once I obtained the installation image I had to flash it onto my phone. In the
past this typically required some sort of jailbreak. Nowadays it seems that
more and more manufacturers permit installation of custom images without a need
for jailbreaking the phone<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. This was indeed the case for my Samsung S7.</p>
<p>Image installation is a two stage process. Firstly, I had to install a custom
recovery image onto the phone. My understanding of a recovery image is that
this is a low-level bootloader that allows installing a custom OS image as well
as performing low-level management of the phone. In my case the recovery image
contained <a href="https://twrp.me/faq/whatistwrp.html">TWRP</a>. Once the recovery image
was installed I could then flash the LineageOS image. All of that was done by
connecting the phone to a PC via a USB cable and required having two tools on my
Linux - <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code>.</p>
<p>I have to say that booting LineageOS for the first time was stressful. I was
afraid that I might brick my phone, but none of that happened. All worked as
expected and the new system booted without problems.</p>
<h2 id="getting-applications">Getting applications</h2>
<p>Once the system was up and running I proceeded with installing applications on
it. One method of doing it is installing applications distributed in .apk files
via USB. This is not a convenient way of getting new software onto the phone,
but it is required to at least install <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>. F-Droid
is an application store, except that it contains open source applications<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Using F-Droid I installed <a href="https://github.com/whyorean/AuroraStore">Aurora
Store</a>, an open-source Google Play
Store client that allows you to install applications from the official store.
At this point one can just install needed applications in the usual way.</p>
<h2 id="the-user-experience">The user experience</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the most important thing - how was the user experience? In
short, it was good but somewhat worse than the original OS provided by Samsung.
Here is a list of problems I ran into.</p>
<p>Firstly, the official Samsung OS was based on Android 8, whereas LineageOS 14 I
installed onto the phone was based on Android 7. That in itself made for a
noticeable downgrade. It took me quite a while to get used to the look and feel
of applications shipped with LineageOS. In particular, I didn’t like how some
of the applications, e.g. SMS app, did not even allow me to change the colour.
Note also that we are talking about very old Android and LineageOS versions. I
suspect that both the looks of applications as well as customization options are
very different in the more recent versions.</p>
<p>Another downgrade that was obvious from the very beginning was the keyboard. It
not only, similarly to other system apps, lacked customization options but it
also provided noticeably worse hints. I had to find a replacement. This was a
difficult choice to make. Sure, hints in Google’s GBoard are great, but using
it comes at the expense of privacy. Indeed, keyboard software is at the core of
a system’s privacy and security since anything you type (emails, passwords)
comes through that application. After extended research I decided to go with
<a href="https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io/">AnySoftKeyboard</a>. I don’t know if this was
the best choice, but it definitely was an acceptable choice. But again I have
to stress: the quality of hints was noticeably worse than with GBoard. At least
for the Polish language, which I primarily use.</p>
<p>I mentioned the Aurora Store as a client to Google Play Store. One nice thing
it can do is allow application downloads via an anonymous account. Obviously,
anonymous login will not allow you to access paid apps assigned to your Google
account, if you happen to have such. What was an issue is that the app would
break every now and then. This is inherent in these kinds of open-source
replacements for proprietary clients: every time the API changes the client app
breaks. On certain occasions I also found that anonymous downloads did not
work, but logging into my Google account would solve the problem<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. One very
nice feature that Aurora Store has, but Google’s official software lacks, is the
ability to filter apps based on in-app advertisements and reliance on GSF. This
is a great feature and I miss it now that I’m back on a Google-based Android.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, applications that require GSF can experience problems.
This will range from certain functionalities being broken, e.g. Discord not
showing notifications, to not running at all. I personally was not seriously
affected by this, but I am not a heavy smartphone user. In particular I do not
use social media and their associated applications, and from what I read these
can exhibit problems. The only application that I had to give up was InPost
Mobile, which is an app by a delivery company that operates a dense network of
parcel lockers throughout Poland. This wasn’t a big problem though since I can
still use these parcel lockers via SMS messages.</p>
<p>I also experienced two serious usability issues. The first one was with the
loudspeaker. Apparently, LineageOS couldn’t do echo cancellation so whenever I
switched to a loudspeaker during a call, the caller would hear their own voice.
This rendered the loudspeaker practically unusable. The second issue was photo
quality, which had decreased dramatically with photos coming out blurry and with
a lot of grain. I experimented with several photo taking applications,
including ones that have really good reviews on the web, but none of them
improved the situation, and many made even worse photos. <strong>As a result my phone
became almost useless as a camera and I ended up borrowing my wife’s phone
whenever I had to take photos. This is probably the single biggest downside I
experienced from switching to LineageOS.</strong></p>
<p>Another minor issue I experienced was when attempting to contact Discord support
with a bug report. As soon as they heard I am on an Android without GSF they
dismissed me by saying they <em>“only support Android devices that have the Google
Play Store pre-installed”</em>. I recognize this is not a technical issue with
LineageOS itself, but it might be worth being aware of this kind of attitude
from the developers.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The above list of encountered issues might look discouraging, but for me the
pros of using LineageOS outweigh the cons. Most importantly, having a system
with no Google services that constantly spy on me was a big win. Of course,
proprietary apps still have their own telemetry and it doesn’t look like there’s
anything that can be done about it in the Android ecosystem, other than a
radical move of not using such apps. I also realize that for some people
stepping away from using Google services might be a radical move in itself.</p>
<p>At no time of using LineageOS had I thought of switching to something else.
This is in stark contrast with my current smartphone. After my S7 died I had to
get a new phone ASAP, and being temporarily low on budget I went with the Xiaomi
Redmi Note 10 Pro. Oh my, was that a mistake. The phone comes with
advertisements built into system applications, including aggressive
advertisements that take over the whole screen. Theoretically these ads can be
disabled, but sometimes that doesn’t work and ads display anyway. There’s also
lots of annoying bugs and, despite good technical specs of the phone, the
overall experience isn’t great. Luckily, LineageOS is officially supported on
the phone so I see myself installing LineageOS again at some point in the
relatively near future.</p>

        <h1 id="system-shock-remake">System Shock remake</h1>
<p>System Shock is a franchise that has been very influential artistically and at
the same time not a great commercial success. Since the latter is the more
important factor in deciding which games get made it is no surprise that up
until recently we’ve only seen two entries in the series: the original System
Shock from 1994 and its sequel System Shock 2 from 1999. That has recently
changed with the release of the long awaited System Shock remake, which I
finished playing a few evenings ago.</p>
<p>Before I talk about the remake let’s quickly revisit two previous games and why
they were important. System Shock games belong to the immersive sim genre,
which is typically characterized by non-linear gameplay combined with emphasis
on exploration, permitting players to solve problems in different ways
(e.g. direct confrontation vs. stealth), and RPG elements<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In addition to
that, System Shock is a cyberpunk survival horror where you face a rogue AI
known as SHODAN, possibly one of the most known villains in video gaming. Other
immersive sims you might have heard about are the first Deus Ex, BioShock (a
spiritual successor to System Shock that has been both critically and
financially successful), and Dishonored.</p>
<p>To me personally System Shock is an important series, though I somewhat feel I
am not entitled to saying this. That’s because I didn’t really play the first
System Shock. As for System Shock 2 I never finished it despite several
attempts at doing so, including a co-op one over the network some 20 years ago.
SS2 was just too difficult for me, the main problem being enemies that kept
respawning if one did not move forward quickly enough. I remember having my
ammo supplies depleted and attempting to fight my way through with melee
weapons, which at some point was just not possible since enemies were too tough.
But despite these failures at completing the game I spent many hours with it,
and its cyber-horror atmosphere was very influential on me. It got me to name
my computers after rogue AIs from science-fiction works, a habit that I’ve been
faithful to for the past two decades and including well-known characters like
SHODAN or GLaDOS, as well as more obscure ones such as
<a href="https://soma.fandom.com/wiki/WAU">WAU</a>.</p>
<h2 id="short-history-of-long-development">Short history of long development</h2>
<p>Let’s quickly talk about how the System Shock remake came to be. It was first
announced to the public in 2016, when a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/">Kickstarter
campaign</a> was
launched by Nightdive Studios to fund the development. Importantly, the
campaign was accompanied by a playable demo of the game that demonstrated that
the team has both a vision of what the game should be as well as skills needed
to bring that vision to life. All it needed was time and money. System Shock
is a beloved franchise for many and the campaign ended in a success, totalling
1.35M dollars out of 0.9M dollars requested, exceeding the requested funds by a
50% margin. Funding was secured, vertical slice already implemented and the
release date set for late 2017 ‒ what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Apparently, a lot. I feel the development history of System Shock remake will
be written about in books<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. A brief summary is that the team attempted to
expand the scope of the project and ran out of money. Development was put on
hold, with Nightdive Studios searching for partners that would help fund the
game. System Shock missed seven release dates. Some of them in a very bad
style with announced date passing without a single word from the developer about
yet another delay. These delays as well as other things that happened during
development have been detailed by user Shoot Man on GOG.com forums
<a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/system_shock_series/what_a_surprise_the_release_date_was_a_lie/page3">here</a>.
Despite the predictions of some that claimed the game will never see a release,
System Shock remake was finally released in May 2023<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I am happy to say
that despite troubled development it is a very good game.</p>
<h2 id="a-great-immersive-sim">A great immersive sim</h2>
<p>In System Shock you play as the Hacker. After a short opening sequence ‒
which, by the way, I found confusing, having trouble figuring out what I need to
do in the first room ‒ you wake up on the Medical deck of Citadel, a space
station orbiting Saturn. You need to make your way through the station decks
all the way to the bridge to stop the rogue AI SHODAN. What is beautiful about
System Shock is lack of any explicit mission objectives and mission markers that
would guide you by hand. It is up to you to explore the environment and piece
together transmissions from few survivors on the station as well as audio logs
of those who did not survive. In the end you are left with knowledge of <em>what</em>
to do and it is up to you to find the required items and places where to make
use of them.</p>

<figcaption>
Audio logs are your primary source of information.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The beginning of the game is difficult. You are short on ammo so getting
through the initial decks requires relying heavily on basic melee weapons, pipe
and wrench.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/pipe.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/pipe_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

<figcaption>
Wrench is just slightly more powerful.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Later these get replaced by a powerful Laser Rapier, which is one of the best
weapons in the game. Its only downside is the fact that it’s a melee weapon,
forcing you to get in close quarters with the enemy. This weapon is identical
in spirit to Dragon’s Tooth sword from the first Deus Ex game.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/rapier.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/rapier_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>
Laser Rapier is still very useful even on the final deck.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Early in the game there’s also a shortage of healing items. You will find
yourself backtracking very often to a surgery machine found in Medical to get
your health fully restored.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/surgery_machine.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/surgery_machine_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At this point it should be clear that System Shock is not a first-person
shooter. Yes, it has a first-person perspective. Yes, there is shooting. But
this is not a game where you keep moving forward, ploughing through dozens of
enemies while shooting left and right. Ammo tends to be in short supply and
that always made me think twice before firing. Do I really need to shoot, or is
there a more resource-efficient way of disposing of an enemy?</p>
<div class="thumbnail">
<figure>
<a href="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/power_station.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2023-10-01-system-shock-remake/power_station_thumbnail.jpg" /></a>
<figcaption>
Aside from ammo you will need energy to power cybernetic upgrades and some weapons.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Unlike many immersive sims, System Shock doesn’t really have significant RPG
elements. You will find cybernetic upgrades throughout the game, ones that
allow you to move faster, jump higher, withstand radiation, etc. But that’s as
far as character progression goes. The only choices that you get to make that
influence your playing experience are weapons. There are several types of hand
arms, rifles, and heavier weapons, as well as mines and grenades. Additionally,
most weapons have two ammo types or firing modes, as well as upgrades. This
allows for a variety of play styles and tactics that can be employed against
enemies. However, inventory space is limited and each weapon takes up space in
that inventory. There is no way to carry every single weapon that you come
across, especially given that ammo also takes up space. Hard choices have to be
made and some weapons will get left behind. My standard armament was the DG-04
Laser Rapier, Magnum 2100 Pistol (I ended up running out of ammo for it towards
the end of the game), KF-18 Scorpion SMG, and, last but not least, EM-83 Grenade
Launcher for dealing with heavy stuff. The grenade launcher is especially
powerful when combined with EMP grenades, which can disable every enemy
(including bosses!) for several seconds.</p>
<p>Backtracking is an essential element of System Shock experience. Levels will be
traversed back and forth, and revisited many times. Since the game does not
guide you by hand, you also have a certain degree of freedom about the order in
which to explore the decks. The first deck is Medical, followed by Research.
From Research you can go either to the Reactor ‒ that was my choice,
though I think I might have made the game slightly more difficult for myself
‒ or Maintenance. Maintenance deck is the closest you’ll get to a central
hub in System Shock. From it you can go further to Storage, Flight Deck, or
Executive. Executive level provides access to remaining decks of Engineering,
Security and the Bridge, which are traversed in linear order, with Security
being the point of no return. Certain enemies will respawn, so backtracking
isn’t entirely stress-free. However, game balance is much better than in System
Shock 2, so you don’t run the risk of completely running out of ammo<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Also,
most decks will have a respawn station that you can unlock to have your body
rebuild when you die, allowing for infinite attempts at beating through the
enemies, even if it’s only with a wrench. In fact at an early point in the
game, at the Reactor deck, I had to resort to this technique. This was one
point of the game that I found quite tedious and regretted my choice of
difficulty settings.</p>
<p>System Shock allows you to adjust the difficulty of four aspects of the game:
combat, mission, puzzles and cyberspace. (More on the latter two in a moment.)
Unfortunately, these settings can only be selected when starting a new game and
cannot be changed later. As usual I went with medium settings and at several
points in the game I regretted not going with easier combat. Having played
through the game though I have a feeling of satisfaction and think that combat
wasn’t really that tough for most of the time, and a few difficulty spikes make
it all the more memorable.</p>
<p>Aside from combat you will encounter two other types of challenges. First one
is cyberspace. Throughout Citadel station there are cyberspace terminals that
transport you to a gravity-less 3D cyberspace, where you can move freely and
have to fight waves of enemies. (Remember Descent?) The goal is to destroy
large crystals hidden inside, which typically results in opening previously
locked doors in the real world.</p>

<p>Second type of challenges you’ll encounter are hacking puzzles. These come in
two types. One requires rewiring a power board to deliver the desired power
output. There are switches to redirect or cut off a path of energy, sum gates
that add powers of incoming signals and multiplexer gates that split one path
into two while retaining the power. The other type of puzzle requires
connecting two buttons by rotating pipes located on the board. It took me a
moment to figure out how these puzzles work, but once I grasped the basic rules
most were fairly simple.</p>

<p>As you might have already noticed, System Shock remake goes for a unique art
style, combining low-resolution environment textures with modern dynamic
lighting. This works extremely well and results in a visually stunning
experience. If there is anything I could complain about when it comes to the
graphics it would be the lack of diversity in dead crew models. It feels like
every dead person looks exactly the same. That’s not a thing that hinders
playing experience in any way, but could have been done better.</p>

<figcaption>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Sadly, I can’t give the audio side of the game as much praise. Firstly, the
soundtrack is lacklustre. The music isn’t bad, but isn’t exceptional either.
Having spent probably over 15 hours in the game the only piece of music that I
can now remember is a jingle played in the lift when moving between levels. The
way the game switches between exploration and combat music is poorly executed.
Combat music kicks in 3-4 seconds after starting combat, but in many cases the
enemy is already dead by that time. So the combat music starts playing after
combat has taken place and keeps playing for 10-15 more seconds even though
there is no threat nearby. This is very confusing leading to a complete discord
between music and the in-game events. Other problems with the sound are related
to noise made by enemies. The way sound is implemented makes it very difficult
to determine enemy location from the noise they are making. In particular, in
some places enemies can be heard through the walls in ways that should
absolutely be impossible in the real world. All in all, both music and
environment sounds should support what is being displayed on the screen, but in
System Shock they really don’t, which is a shame.</p>
<p>One last complaint I am going to make is about the ending, which is practically
non-existent and very disappointing. I am going to spoil it in this paragraph,
though there isn’t really much to spoil. So you make your way through the
Bridge deck, killing SHODAN’s minions, and reaching the final cyberspace. That
one cyberspace is a special one: you don’t float freely, but rather walk with a
weapon. There is no usual health bar. You can die, but if that happens you are
immediately respawned and allowed to continue. In other words you can’t fail.
This in itself isn’t bad ‒ symbolic fight with the final boss can be a
good way of telling a story. Once you destroy a large something in cyberspace (I
have no clue what that is) you are taken out of cyberspace to witness SHODAN
changing her colour from green to blue (presumably her moral restraints being
re-instantiated?). Then the Hacker just sits next to SHODAN, tired and
exhausted. And that’s really it. SHODAN, who has been a looming, threatening
presence throughout the game, stays completely silent. Even as you make your
way through the bridge she barely says anything. She no longer mocks or
threatens you, and makes no attempts to convince you to stop. And then, once
the whole ordeal is finished, nothing happens. This is very anticlimactic and
disappointing. This ending left me with no sense of completion. Admittedly,
the ending is faithful to the original one, but in that particular case I would
appreciate a departure. Ending of the remake has been widely criticized and in
fact Nightdive Studios promised it will be reworked. We are yet to see how this
turns out.</p>

The End.

</div>
<h2 id="more-system-shock-please">More System Shock, please!</h2>
<p>Despite a couple of minor complaints System Shock remake is possibly the best
game I played this year and I am not saying this lightly, since back in April I
finished Final Fantasy X. I really liked the atmosphere of Citadel station, the
omnipresence of SHODAN, and the retro-futuristic style of the game. I hope
System Shock remake is successful financially and that we will see more games
from the series in near future. So far things don’t look particularly well in
that regard, though. System Shock 3 has been announced to be in development
several years ago but it seems the development has been halted and the game is
now in a limbo, with neither cancellation nor development being officially
confirmed. There have also been talks about the possibility of having System
Shock 2 remake, but this is again in the realm of wishful thinking. Nightdive
Studios has the full rights to System Shock 2, so this certainly does not seem
impossible. The only question is whether people would trust Nightdive on
another Kickstarter campaign.</p>

    <section>
        <h1 id="all-the-things-ive-ever-done-wrong-with-my-websites">All the things I’ve ever done wrong with my websites</h1>
<p>This post has been long in the making. I started writing it in March, and now,
four months later, it is finally finished. I was inspired by Fabien Sanglard’s
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html">post about technical aspects of his
blog</a> and it made me reflect on all
my past and present web sites and things I did wrong when creating and hosting
them. I’ve been maintaining some form of online presence, whether a homepage, a
blog, or a fansite, for the past 23 years so there was a lot to reflect on.
Here’s a chronological list.</p>
<h2 id="fremen-zone">Fremen Zone</h2>
<p>This will be a trip down memory lane. Fremen Zone was my fansite dedicated to
Frank Herbert’s “Dune” novel and related works such as games and movies. I
started it when I was in high school back in 1999. By that time I already knew
how to program, but creating web sites was a new thing for me. I wanted both to
share my fascination with the Dune universe as well as learn how to create web
pages. This was also the time when lots of online portals offered free hosting.
In the west this was typically GeoCities, but here in Poland I used Onet. When
signing up one would not only get an email address but also a few megabytes of
disk space to host a website. I know that by today’s standards 2 or 5
megabytes is laughably low, but back then it was more than enough. Later in its
lifetime Fremen Zone changed hosting and included some multimedia downloads,
growing the page size to a total of around 75 megabytes.</p>
<p>Fremen Zone was initially intended to be dedicated to the Dune II strategy game.
A very rough first prototype looked like this (this is the highest resolution
screenshot I have):</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<figcaption>
First prototype.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It was quickly discarded and replaced with another prototype, this time with
scope extended to contain the books. As you can see the working name of the
website was also different:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<figcaption>
Second prototype.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Both prototypes were created using Microsoft FrontPage, a WYSIWYG HTML editor.
However, I quickly realized that, firstly, I am not learning much by using this
kind of tool and, secondly, that the generated HTML is bloated and unlikely to
work on web browsers other than Internet Explorer, such as Netscape Navigator.
As a result I switched to writing HTML and CSS by hand. The results were very
good and I think they still hold up well even today:</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Fremen Zone went online in June 2000. The process of first creating and then
maintaining it was a lot different from what we do today. First and foremost, I
didn’t have Internet access at home. This meant I had to update all the files
in advance and then upload them when visiting my dad’s work during the weekend.
These weekend visits were also the only time when I could browse the Internet to
find any information for the website, although this wasn’t a big problem since
practically all of the content was created by me based on reading the books,
playing the games, and watching the movies. The only significant exception were
reviews of the last three books in the original Dune cycle, which I have not yet
read when I started creating Fremen Zone. Luckily, Dune was quite a popular
books amongst my peers and a friend of mine who read all the books agreed to
provide missing reviews. With no Internet access at home this was a
logistically complicated process, since said friend lived in a different part of
city. We spent a long time on the phone discussing the books, the page, and
writing reviews, which resulted in phone bills going up significantly. Again,
not a trivial problem in late 90s Poland. I also mentioned that Fremen Zone
contained some downloads. These included, among others, Dune and Dune II games,
which back then were considered abandonware<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Fremen Zone was last updated in 2004. At some point there wasn’t much more to
write about and the page simply existed without any supervision. It eventually
withered away and disappeared when its free hosting was closed down. I have no
recollection of when that happened. A copy of the website has been sitting on
my hard drive all this time and as I was writing this post I thought to myself
“why not bring Fremen Zone” back to life? <a href="https://jstolarek.github.io/fremenzone/">And so I
did</a>. Using GitHub as a hosting
service it took two afternoons to put it online. In fact it could have been
hosted as it was, but I wanted to move away from ISO-8859-2 and CP-1250
encodings in favour of UTF-8. I also wanted to replace self-extracting RAR
archives with ZIP ones.</p>

<p>In retrospect I am very happy about how the Fremen Zone turned out. The fact
that after over two decades the page “just works” shows how future-proof pure
that HTML and CSS are. Perhaps the only complaint that could be made is that it
doesn’t look good on mobile devices, but honestly speaking I couldn’t care less
about that. When it comes to the Fremen Zone I can proudly say I made no
mistakes. As you will see below this is not the case for my other websites.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filling the website with content is lots of fun.</li>
<li>Hand-written HTML and CSS are great, though full-scale redesigns are
tedious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evolutionary-biology-blog-at-blogger.com">Evolutionary biology blog at blogger.com</h2>
<p>Towards the end of my university studies I picked interest in evolutionary
biology. I read lots of books on the subject and I have to credit works of
Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins, and E. O. Wilson as being the biggest influence
in forming my approach to research and science in general. (For the record, I
studied computer science, not biology.) I decided to turn that fascination of
biology into a blog. It contained mostly reviews of popular science books about
biology, myrmecology, cognitive science, and occasionally modern physics and
cosmology.</p>
<p>I decided to host my blog using one of many blogging services available in the
noughties. After some consideration I went with Google’s Blogger, with first
post being published in 2008. Blogger is designed as a user-friendly CMS with
some (limited) options to customise layout. Post editing is done using an
online WYSIWYG editor, with everything being saved immediately (at least in
theory). Over time I grew to dislike that editor. It isn’t a horribly bad
experience but editing inside a text field embedded in a browser window is far
from being the best possible experience. There was always the option to switch
it to pure HTML mode, but as you might guess two modes weren’t perfectly
compatible as code generated from the editor wasn’t exactly what one would write
by hand, and conversely, code written by hand sometimes wasn’t parsed correctly
in WYSIWYG mode.</p>
<p>In the end I think the biggest problem with Blogger was taking ownership of
created content. There is the ever-looming threat of service joining the
<a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google Graveyard</a>. Although Blogger allows to
export all posts to an XML file, it seems to be only able to export text, with
all images being lost in the export process.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use a service that doesn’t allow you to export all created content.
Always make sure to own everything that you created. Ideally, don’t depend
on an external service at all.</li>
<li>Online WYSIWYG editors are somewhat inconvenient.</li>
<li>Blogging is fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="professional-homepage-version-1-plain-html">Professional homepage, version 1: plain HTML</h2>
<p>In late 2008 I started my work at Politechnika Łódzka<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (PŁ for short). Back
then PŁ didn’t have a unified online learning platform and so each employee used
their personal web page to provide learning materials for the students. I had
to create such a page for myself and since I needed it ASAP I chose the easiest
solution: hand-written HTML with practically no CSS, other than white
background. The page wasn’t fancy but it did the job of delivering basic
information.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, hand-written HTML and CSS are great.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="professional-homepage-version-2-dokuwiki">Professional homepage, version 2: DokuWiki</h2>
<p>That first version of my professional homepage was intended to be a temporary
solution but in the end it lasted for about 3 years until 2011. What made me
move on was reading <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/">“Pragmatic Thinking and
Learning”</a>,
which convinced me that it is a good idea to have a personal wiki to organize my
research. One of my colleagues pointed me to DokuWiki, which he described as a
lightweight wiki being solely based on markdown-formatted text files and thus
requiring no database. This convinced me. No database requirement made it easy
to set up, and versatility of configuration made it possible to tweak everything
to my liking. From now on DokuWiki acted both as my official homepage,
containing information for students and my research portfolio, as well as my
personal wiki, which was hidden behind a login. I could now organize all my
research notes into pages and the ease of doing that meant I was now making a
lot more notes than I used to. I also really liked plugin support. One of the
plugins allowed to me have both Polish and English version of each publicly
visible subpage. Another provided LaTeX support, allowing to render formulas
related to wavelet transforms.</p>

</div>
<p>While at first I was quite impressed with DokuWiki, over time I realized that it
doesn’t quite live up to the promise of its storage being entirely text based.
While the current content of all the pages is indeed stored in text files, under
the hood DokuWiki maintains history of all the edits (after all, it is designed
to host a wiki) as well as an elaborate system of all sorts of caches and
indices. This means that editing the text files directly instead of using the
HTML editor can potentially get you into trouble with internal data consistency.
And while above I stated how DokuWiki made it easy to make notes, over time my
workflow evolved towards being terminal-based and at this point using a separate
browser-embedded editor to take notes became a problem. Moreover, all the
caches and historical records are binary files and therefore storing sources of
the website in a version control system was also a bit of a problem.</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a personal wiki is a fantastic idea. However, it must be possible to
easily integrate the process of taking notes with the rest of my workflow.
Therefore, HTML editors suck.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yet-another-lambda-blog">Yet Another Lambda Blog</h2>
<p>When I got into functional programming back in 2012 I thought it would be a
great idea to also run a blog on the topic. Aside from the fact that I enjoy
sharing my knowledge with others, a blog would also serve a similar purpose as
the personal wiki. It would be a place where I can record my knowledge for
future purposes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I have already learned that relying on an external blog
hosting service is not a good idea - I already knew I want full ownership of the
content I create - so I decided to go with self-hosting and set up a blog CMS
along with my homepage on my university’s server. Today I can safely say that
while the assumptions were good, the execution was not: I went with Wordpress.</p>
<p>Wordpress seemed like a good choice due to amount of offered features, both
built-in and available via additional plugins. A variety of themes meant I had
no problem adjusting the looks of the blog to my liking. Similarly to Blogger,
Wordpress offered an online WYSIWYG, which at this point I was still willing to
tolerate. What proved to be the biggest downside was the maintenance burden.
Firstly, since the instance was self-hosted, I was responsible for keeping my
installation up-to-date. Most updates went fine, but some did not and I found
myself spending hours trying to recover from a failed update. An unexpected
obstacle came from my hosting, which turned out to be using an extremely old
release of <a href="https://www.pld-linux.org/">PLD Linux</a> with a woefully out-of-date
PHP version that has not received any security updates for about a decade. At
some point this became a problem since Wordpress bumped their minimal required
PHP version and I was no longer able to update my installation. This is a big
deal. Due to its popularity, Wordpress installations, especially those outdated
ones without security fixes, are a common target for hacker attacks. Moreover,
spambots are a major issue, with spam making up over 99,99% of all comments. In
order to manage this spam you either turn off comments completely or use a
plugin for filtering spam (I used Akismet). Lastly, there’s the issue of
backups. Wordpress has plugins that allow you to backup all of your
installation, but moving contents backed up this way to a different installation
is not a straightforward task. Or at least was not straightforward last time I
tried it - perhaps things have improved?</p>
<p>Overall, using a self-hosted Wordpress installation was a major pain with lots
of time spent on maintenance. Even though I now owned all the content I
created, the fact that it was all stored in a database made it difficult to
backup or migrate.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>

<li>Comment system is a major source of pain.</li>
<li>Blogging is still fun.</li>

<h2 id="cyberbrain4-gollum-based-personal-wiki">Cyberbrain<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>: gollum-based personal wiki</h2>
<p>At some point I have found myself no longer using my personal wiki. It’s not
that I stopped using it suddenly. It just happened gradually over time. This
really surprised me, since a personal wiki is a Good Thing and many times have I
been grateful for taking the time to write down various things that I’ve
learned. After thinking about it for a while I realized the cause: I really
hated the online interface. It was slow and completely disconnected from my
workflow: I spent 90% of my work time in the terminal, using Emacs in text mode
as my editor. Making notes in the wiki meant switching to the browser and using
a completely different way of editing text than the one I use normally. This
was too heavyweight and requires too large a context switch.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem came in the form of
<a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/">gollum</a>. Gollum is a markdown based wiki
engine that can run as a local service on my machine. And this time “markdown
based” really means what it means - no weird caching or indexing like in
DokuWiki. Gollum requires that the wiki is stored in a git repository and as
such all history is recorded outside of the wiki engine itself. In fact, most
of you have likely already seen gollum in action as it is the engine that was
originally created to power GitHub wikis<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Multiple markdown flavours are
supported, but the DokuWiki one isn’t, so I had to migrate all notes I already
had on my personal wiki.</p>
<p>Once migration was done I had a perfect wiki. All my notes are now stored in
Markdown files (GitHub Markdown with minor tweaks and enhancements) organized in
directories. Since it’s Markdown it is easy to edit in Emacs, which allows me
to seamlessly integrate taking notes with programming. In fact, for most of the
time I view my notes in Emacs. I switch to a web browser view of the wiki only
when I need to retrieve information which location in the wiki I am unsure of
and I need to click through several pages in order to find it. This doesn’t
happen too often since I try to keep my wiki organized. At the moment all my
notes total at 1.5MB - and that’s just text-based Markdown files, excluding any
multimedia or git history - so it is crucial that they are all well structured.
Moreover, storing everything in a git repository is now not only a natural thing
to do, but in fact mandatory. To simplify my workflow with the wiki even
further I created a <code>Makefile</code> with following contents:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode makefile"><code class="sourceCode makefile"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">all:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="er">       </span>git add .</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>       git commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Local changes (via Makefile)&quot;</span> || exit 0</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">.PHONY:</span><span class="dt"> all</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which allows me to commit all changes to my wiki by pressing F8 in Emacs.
Granted, the commit message is not descriptive, but in all honesty I don’t think
I ever found myself referring to my wiki’s history.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="professional-homepage-with-a-blog-version-3-hakyll-github-pages">Professional homepage with a blog, version 3: Hakyll + GitHub pages</h2>
<p>After switching to gollum I was still using DokuWiki to run my professional
homepage. That page, as well as Wordpress-based Yet Another Lambda Blog, came
to an end in 2021. After spending 13 years at my University I decided to change
jobs, which meant losing access to my hosting. I had to migrate everything
somewhere else.</p>
<p>All my experiences so far lead me to one conclusion: the simpler the better. I
didn’t want anything that uses a database. I didn’t want a comment system. I
wanted to store everything in a simple text-based format that is easy to migrate
and store in a git repository. This left me with two choices: either plain
HTML+CSS or a Markdown-based solution. I wasn’t yet ready to return to using
HTML. After considering my options I decided to go with
<a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a static HTML generator inspired by
Jekyll, but written in Haskell.</p>
<p>I wanted to combine my professional homepage with a blog. This meant migrating
already existing DokuWiki pages, which was simple since I already knew how to
handle this from earlier migration to gollum, but it also meant migrating from
Wordpress to Markdown. This was a bigger problem, but luckily I found a tool
that did 90% of the job of converting existing blog posts to Markdown. There
were still cleanups and tweaks here and there, in particular when it came to
images and footnotes. The process was tedious but overall not that long.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of other stuff that had to be set up in Hakyll, from RSS feed
to creating templates and metadata for blog pages, and various rules defining
how and where to put various files (in particular images). Luckily, Hakyll
documentation and online examples were helpful, and after about a week of work
the migration was complete. You are most likely viewing the result right now,
but in case another migration happens in the future here’s a screenshot:</p>

<figcaption>
Current homepage and blog built with Hakyll.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Overall, once setup Hakyll is easy to use and does the job. It still has its
downsides though. Firstly, it is a rather heavyweight technology in a sense
that it requires full Haskell toolchain to be installed in the system, plus a
bunch of library dependencies. I am a Haskell programmer so I tend to have
Haskell compiler at hand, but this is no small requirement. And being
Markdown-based leads to limitations that you’re going to hit sooner or later.
For me this happened when I decided I want to have captioned images that can be
enlarged with a click. To achieve the desired effect I had to mix HTML with
Markdown and write some extra CSS to ensure images display correctly on mobile
devices. So whenever I want to insert an image I have to write something like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">div</span><span class="ot"> class</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;thumbnail&quot;</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></span>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static site generation is great.</li>
<li>Markdown is good enough for basic formatting, but sooner or later you hit
its limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>At the moment the only active web page that I maintain is this blog running on
Hakyll. Once set up it is easy to work with and allows me to do everything I
need. That being said, I am not happy about Hakyll’s weight, in particular its
dependence on a plethora of Haskell libraries. It was trivially simple to bring
Fremen Zone back to life after two decades of no maintenance. Will it be
equally easy to restore this blog in two decades time? I have serious doubts
about that, but nevertheless have no intention of migrating to anything else.
For now.</p>
<p>Restoring the Fremen Zone back to life sparked a new desire in me. While I said
I have no intention of updating it, I feel like re-doing the whole site from
scratch. All the reviews on the page were written from a perspective of a
teenager. Today, being middle-aged, I view most of things surprisingly
similarly, but would definitely make a better choice of words in expressing
myself. And so I am slowly gathering material for a new Dune fanpage. All the
lessons above have taught me to avoid complexity and stay as close to the basics
as possible. And so my plan is to create a new website based on pure HTML and
CSS. This will take some learning effort. I haven’t used these technologies in
a while and they have evolved in the past two decades, in particular when it
comes to handling mobile devices. My experience with creating Fremen Zone 20
years ago taught me that creating content is a time consuming process, and
therefore I am assuming this new website will take years, rather than months, to
complete.</p>

<p>Since my <a href="2023-01-23-gameboy-color-nes-themed-modkit-from-funnyplaying.html">previous post about modding a GameBoy
Color</a>, back
in January, I have modded three more GameBoys: a GameBoy Pocket, an original
GameBoy DMG, and a GameBoy Advance. I want to talk about the first two today,
leaving the third one for later.</p>
<h2 id="gameboy-pocket">GameBoy Pocket</h2>
<p>I already have one modded GameBoy Pocket, but I wanted to make another one for
my wife. I got a donor GBP with a damaged screen that had a wide black stripe
running from top to bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>Modding GBP is very similar to GBC, so it went pretty smooth. Similarly to GBC,
I trimmed the cartridge slot pins and secured them with Kapton tape.</p>

<p>When I was making the NES-themed GBC I reported how replacing the speaker with a
new one resulted in no sound. I don’t know why that was the case but back then
I just restored the old speaker. I decided to try using remaining replacement
speaker in this build and it worked without any problems. I have no clue what I
did wrong with the GBC.</p>

<p>When installing the screen I always have a dilemma whether to use the provided
3M dust seal. A supposed advantage of using it is that it should provide
protection against dust getting between the screen and the lens<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. A clear
disadvantage is that once the screen is glued to the seal it cannot be removed
without being destroyed. It also cannot be even adjusted in any way. After some
deliberation I decided to install the dust seal, which required cutting small
fragments on the side so that it fits in the shell.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s some more soldering required. One contact on the ribbon cable
must be soldered to the power switch in order to provide enough power for the
screen, while another is used to solder a touch sensor. With these finished I
was ready to assemble the console. Here are a couple of photos of the finished
build.</p>

<p>One thing that didn’t go quite right is the centring of the screen. The photos
don’t show this well, but the screen is slightly shifted to the left so that the
left edge of the displayed image is covered. And since the screen is now glued
to the dust seal it’s not possible to adjust it. I might decide to fix this one
day at the expense of sacrificing a screen, which are not that expensive.</p>
<h2 id="gameboy-dmg">GameBoy DMG</h2>
<p>I also have one modded GameBoy DMG in my collection. Shortly before returning
from the UK to Poland I bought it from eBay with all mods already installed. I
knew GameBoys will be harder to find in Poland - well, not really harder to
find, just more expensive - so I decided to get one that’s already modded since
I didn’t have the time to mod it myself. However, I wasn’t entirely happy with
how that GameBoy looks. I could have just replaced the shell with a new one,
but I figured it would be more fun to get a new GameBoy DMG and mod it myself.
As expected, GameBoys in Poland are expensive so I got one from Sweden since it
was cheaper (sic!). The unit was sold as faulty/not working, but I don’t really
believe in such a thing as a broken GameBoy. There is a GameBoy that literally
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/8ifqbp/gameboy_at_nintendo_nyc_store_damaged_in_bombing/">survived a bombing during the Gulf War and it still
works</a>.
I assume there is simply no way that a DMG can’t be fixed.</p>
<p>When the unit arrived it had a missing lens, damage on the screen, and signs of
spilled acid in the battery compartment.</p>

<p>I put in the batteries and - surprise, surprise - it didn’t power on. Well, the
seller wasn’t lying. I thought this must have something to do either with
corrosion from spilled batteries or the power switch. My first debugging step
was to check continuity between the battery contacts.</p>

<p>In the photo above my multimeter shows no continuity between the spring and a
metal plate that spring is attached to. Looks like the acid must have gotten
between the plate and the spring causing corrosion. The easiest way to test
whether this is indeed the problem was transferring the main board to a new
shell.</p>

<p>I inserted the batteries, turned the console on, and it Just Worked. So the
problem was with the damaged contacts from spilled batteries. I was glad this
went so easily. If the problem was with the power switch this repair would have
gotten much more difficult.</p>
<p>The DMG actually consists of two boards. One is the main board with a CPU -
that’s the one in photo above - while the other connects to the screen and also
contains button contacts. Installing a new IPS panel requires replacing the
other board with a new one. It also requires soldering a speaker and this is
the only soldering required by this mod.</p>

<p>I was now ready to install the screen and the lens, and assemble everything
together. This kit comes with a very nice mounting bracket for the screen. It
fits very tightly, ensuring that the screen is correctly centred. It also
covers components on the ribbon cable so there is no need to secure them with
Kapton tape as I did in my other GameBoys.</p>

<p>One minor issue that appeared during the final assembly was insufficient number
of screws to attach the screen and button board to the shell. Eight are
required but the kit came with only six. My solution was to use the screws
from original GameBoy, though these turned out to be slightly too long.</p>
<p>This build was surprisingly quick, taking me less than two hours. I am very
happy with the end result, though as usual top and bottom of the IPS panel stand
out from under the lens and this is clearly visible in a transparent shell. One
other complain I could possibly have with the shell is that it doesn’t have any
Nintendo or GameBoy branding.</p>

<p>While doing the final tests I discovered one small issue. With this kit the
contrast wheel is repurposed to adjust screen settings: brightness, colour, and
retro pixel mode. I realized that the wheel doesn’t have enough clearance and
is being pressed against the shell and gets stuck in one position.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">

<p>My conjecture is that the problem is caused by the two missing screws mentioned
above. I used the six screws provided with the kit around the button contacts.
From my experience getting the board to fight tightly around the contacts is
crucial for the buttons to work correctly. Two missing screws that I replaced
using ones from the original unit were placed below the screen. As already
mentioned, these screws were a bit too long and didn’t hold the board as tightly
as screws provided with the kit. My guess is that if the board had a tighter
fight there it wouldn’t press the contrast wheel against the shell and all would
work as expected. My ad-hoc solution was to slightly loosen two of the screws
that hold the shell together. Now the contrast wheel can move freely, while the
shell still remains nicely fitted.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, I have also modded a GameBoy Advance
using a TFT panel that I have not used before. I want to spend more time
testing it before writing a post about it. I also have a GameBoy Advance SP
waiting to be modded, but for now I can’t find a shell that I would be happy
with, and I can’t decide what kind of screen to use - a TFT panel mentioned
above or a regular IPS panel? Once I do more testing with the TFT panel I
should be able to decide what components I want to use with the SP. Last but
not least, I have a NeoGeo Pocket Color. Recently I managed to buy a flashcart
for it and now the only thing it needs to be really usable is a new screen.
However, modding GBA SP and NGPC might have to wait for a few months due to
financial reasons.</p>
