<p>Computer science is what I do for the most of my time, but it is not the only thing that occupies my time and thoughts. Below is a short list of my other activities, interests and hobbies.</p>
<h2 id="retro-gaming">Retro gaming</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>I am interested in the history of gaming. I enjoy playing retro games, both on original hardware and using emulators. I have a Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii U, and a humble collection of handhelds, including several modded GameBoys and two PSVitas.</p>
<h2 id="mountain-trekking">Mountain trekking</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/mountain_trekking.jpg" title="In the Cairngorms" />
</p>
<p>I enjoy mountain trekking, especially multi-day trips to remote areas devoid of people. I have been to various ranges of Carpathians in Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine and Romania. Nowadays I trek in the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>When not in the mountains, I enjoy biking in rural areas.</p>
<h2 id="history-and-wargaming">History and wargaming</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/wargaming.jpg?nolink" title="Playing &quot;Ardennes '44&quot;" />
</p>
<p>I see history as an important mean to understand modern world. I am especially interested in the period of Second World War. Antony Beevor is one of my favourite authors. I also like to play wargames, i.e. strategy board games that aim at recreating historical conflicts to allow their better understanding and provide entertainment at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="paper-models-and-aviation">Paper models and aviation</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/models.jpg" title="Curtiss Tomahawk Mk IIB" />
</p>
<p>I usually spend autumn and winter evenings making paper models, a hobby my father introduced me to when I was a kid. I have a keen interest in aviation so most of my models are fighter airplanes from the World War II.</p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary biology</h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ants.jpg" title="Camponotus ligniperdus" />
</p>
<p>Since I am a computer scientist it might come as a surprise that works that influenced me the most as a researcher were those by biologists: Richard Dawkins, Charles Darwin and Edward O. Wilson. One field of biology that I am particularly fond of is myrmecology, ie. research of ants. I even used to have several ant colonies at home! I am also interested in philosophical work that aims to explain phenomena of consciousness and morality through mechanisms of evolution.</p>
