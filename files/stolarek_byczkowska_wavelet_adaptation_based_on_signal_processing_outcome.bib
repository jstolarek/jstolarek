	abstract = "The problem of wavelet synthesis is a crucial part of wavelet theory. In this paper an overview of wavelet synthesis methods used in the literature up till now is given. It is demonstrated that these well known approaches suffer from some major drawbacks. A new approach to adaptive wavelet synthesis that overcomes these drawbacks and has not been exploited before is proposed. This approach is based on adapting wavelet to one particular signal and specific signal processing algorithm."
