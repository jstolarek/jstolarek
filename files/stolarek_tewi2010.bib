Many different wavelet functions have been proposed so far, however there is no wavelet that would be the most suitable for every task. Therefore a method allowing to adaptively synthesize the most suitable wavelet for a given task must be developed. In this paper a general outline of such method will be discussed. A concept of tools used for analysis of adaptive wavelets will be presented."
