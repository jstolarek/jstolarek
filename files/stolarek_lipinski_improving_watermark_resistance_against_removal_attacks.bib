	abstract = "This paper proposes a new approach for enhancing the robustness of wavelet-based image watermarking algorithms. The method adjusts wavelet used in the process of image watermarking in order to maximize resistance against image processing operations. Effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using blind multiplicative watermarking algorithm, but it can easily be generalized to all wavelet-based watermarking algorithms. Presented results demonstrate that wavelets generated using proposed approach outperform other wavelet bases commonly used in image watermarking in terms of robustness to removal attacks."
